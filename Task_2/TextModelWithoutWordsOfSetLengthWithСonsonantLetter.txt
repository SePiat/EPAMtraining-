CHAPTER I
“TOM!”
No answer.
“TOM!”
No answer.
“What’s    boy, I wonder? You TOM!”
No answer.
The old  pulled her spectacles  and looked over  about the ;  she put  up and looked out under . She seldom or never looked through  for so small a thing as a boy;   her state , the pride of her heart, and  built for “style,” not service—she could   through a  of stove-  as . She looked perplexed for a moment, and  , not fiercely, but still  enough for the furniture to :
“, I lay if I get  of you I’ll—”
She did not finish, for by   she was bending  and punching under the bed  the broom, and so she needed breath to punctuate the punches . She resurrected nothing but the cat.
“I never did see the  of  boy!”
She  to the open  and stood in it and looked out among the tomato vines and “jimpson” weeds  constituted the garden. No Tom. So she lifted up her voice at an angle calculated for distance and shouted:
“Y-o-u-u TOM!”
There was a slight noise behind her and she turned  in  to seize a small boy by the slack of his roundabout and arrest his flight.
“There! I might ’a’ thought of  closet.  you  doing in there?”
“Nothing.”
“Nothing!  at  hands. And  at  mouth.  is  truck?”
“I don’t , aunt.”
“, I . It’s jam—that’s  it is. Forty times I’ve  if you didn’t let  jam alone I’d  you.  me  switch.”
The switch hovered in the air—the peril was desperate—
“My!  behind you, aunt!”
The old  whirled round, and snatched her skirts out of danger. The lad  on the instant, scrambled up the  board-fence, and disappeared over it.
His aunt Polly stood surprised a moment, and  broke into a gentle laugh.
“ the boy, can’t I never learn anything? Ain’t he played me tricks enough   for me to be looking out for him by  ? But old fools is the biggest fools there is. Can’t learn an old dog new tricks, as the saying is. But my goodness, he never plays  alike, two , and how is a  to  what’s coming? He ’pears to   how  he can torment me before I get my dander up, and he knows if he can  out to put me off for a minute or  me laugh, it’s all  again and I can’t hit him a . I ain’t doing my  by  boy, and that’s the Lord’s truth, goodness knows. Spare the rod and spile the child, as the   . I’m a laying up sin and suffering for us , I .   of the Old Scratch, but -a-me!  my own  sister’s boy,  thing, and I ain’t got the heart to  him, somehow. Every  I let him off, my conscience   me so, and every  I hit him my old heart  breaks. -a-, man  is  of woman is of few  and  of trouble, as the Scripture , and I reckon it’s so. He’ll  hookey  evening, * and [* Southwestern for “afternoon”] I’ll  be obleeged to  him , tomorrow, to punish him. It’s mighty  to  him  Saturdays,  all the  is having holiday, but he hates    he hates anything else, and I’ve got to do  of my  by him, or I’ll be the ruination of the child.”
Tom did  hookey, and he had a   . He got   barely in season to  Jim, the small colored boy, saw -day’s  and split the kindlings before supper—at least he was there in  to  his adventures to Jim while Jim did three-fourths of the . Tom’s younger brother (or rather -brother) Sid was already through  his  of the  (picking up chips), for he was a quiet boy, and had no adventurous, trouble- .
While Tom was eating his supper, and stealing sugar as opportunity offered, Aunt Polly asked him questions    of guile, and  —for she wanted to  him into damaging revealments.   other simple-hearted souls, it was her pet vanity to believe she was endowed  a talent for  and mysterious diplomacy, and she loved to contemplate her  transparent devices as marvels of low cunning.  she:
“Tom, it was middling  in school, warn’t it?”
“Yes’m.”
“Powerful , warn’t it?”
“Yes’m.”
“Didn’t you  to go in a-swimming, Tom?”
A bit of a scare  through Tom—a touch of uncomfortable suspicion. He searched Aunt Polly’s , but it  him nothing. So he :
“—, not  .”
The old  reached out her  and  Tom’s shirt, and :
“But you ain’t too  now, though.” And it flattered her to reflect  she had discovered  the shirt was dry without anybody knowing   was  she had in her . But in spite of her, Tom  where the  lay, now. So he forestalled  might be the  :
“ of us pumped on our heads—mine’s  yet. See?”
Aunt Polly was vexed to think she had overlooked  bit of circumstantial evidence, and missed a trick.  she had a new inspiration:
“Tom, you didn’t  to undo  shirt collar where I sewed it, to  on  , did you? Unbutton  jacket!”
The trouble vanished out of Tom’s . He opened his jacket. His shirt collar was securely sewed.
“Bother! , go ’long  you. I’d   you’d played hookey and  a-swimming. But I forgive ye, Tom. I reckon you’re a  of a singed cat, as the saying is—better’n you .  .”
She was  sorry her sagacity had miscarried, and    Tom had stumbled into obedient conduct for once.
But Sidney :
“, now, if I didn’t think you sewed his collar  white thread, but it’s black.”
“Why, I did sew it  white! Tom!”
But Tom did not  for the . As he  out at the  he :
“Siddy, I’ll  you for .”
In a  place Tom examined two large needles which  thrust into the lapels of his jacket, and had thread bound about —one needle carried white thread and the other black. He :
“She’d never noticed if it hadn’t  for Sid. Confound it! Sometimes she  it  white, and sometimes she  it  black. I  to gee- she’d stick to one or t’other—I can’t  the run of ’em. But I bet you I’ll lam Sid for . I’ll learn him!”
He was not the Model Boy of the village. He  the model boy   though—and loathed him.
Within two minutes, or even , he had forgotten all his troubles. Not because his troubles  one   heavy and bitter to him  a man’s are to a man, but because a new and powerful interest    and drove  out of his  for the — as men’s misfortunes are forgotten in the excitement of new enterprises.  new interest was a valued novelty in whistling, which he had  acquired  a negro, and he was suffering to practise it un-disturbed. It consisted in a peculiar - , a  of liquid warble, produced by touching the tongue to the  of the mouth at short intervals in the midst of the music—the reader probably remembers how to do it, if he has ever  a boy. Diligence and attention   him the knack of it, and he strode  the street  his mouth  of harmony and his   of gratitude. He   as an astronomer feels who has discovered a new planet—no doubt, as far as strong, , unalloyed pleasure is concerned, the advantage was  the boy, not the astronomer.
The summer evenings  . It was not , yet. Presently Tom checked his whistle. A stranger was before him—a boy a shade larger  himself. A new-comer of any age or either sex was an im-pressive curiosity in the  little shabby village of St. Petersburg.  boy was  dressed, too— dressed on a -day.  was simply astounding. His cap was a dainty thing, his close-buttoned  cloth roundabout was new and natty, and so  his pantaloons. He had shoes on—and it was only Friday. He even  a necktie, a bright bit of ribbon. He had a citified air about him  ate into Tom’s vitals. The  Tom stared at the splendid marvel, the higher he turned up his  at his finery and the shabbier and shabbier his own outfit seemed to him to . Neither boy spoke. If one moved, the other moved—but only sidewise, in a circle;    to  and eye to eye all the . Finally Tom :
“I can  you!”
“I’d  to see you try it.”
“, I can do it.”
“No you can’t, either.”
“Yes I can.”
“No you can’t.”
“I can.”
“You can’t.”
“Can!”
“Can’t!”
An uncomfortable pause.  Tom :
“What’s  ?”
“’Tisn’t any of  business, maybe.”
“ I ’low I’ll  it my business.”
“ why don’t you?”
“If you say , I .”
“——. There now.”
“Oh, you think you’re mighty smart, don’t you? I could  you  one   behind me, if I wanted to.”
“ why don’t you do it? You say you can do it.”
“ I , if you   me.”
“Oh yes—I’ve  whole families in the  fix.”
“Smarty! You think you’re , now, don’t you? Oh,  a hat!”
“You can   hat if you don’t  it. I  you to knock it off—and anybody that’ll  a    eggs.”
“You’re a !”
“You’re another.”
“You’re a fighting  and dasn’t  it up.”
“Aw— a !”
“Say—if you  me   of   I’ll  and bounce a  off’n  .”
“Oh, of course you .”
“ I .”
“ why don’t you do it ?  do you  saying you  for? Why don’t you do it? It’s because you’re afraid.”
“I ain’t afraid.”
“You are.”
“I ain’t.”
“You are.”
Another pause, and  eying and sidling around each other. Presently   shoulder to shoulder. Tom :
“Get away  !”
“Go away yourself!”
“I won’t.”
“I won’t either.”
So  stood, each  a  placed at an angle as a brace, and  shoving  might and , and glowering at each other  . But neither could get an advantage. After struggling    hot and flushed, each relaxed his strain  watchful caution, and Tom :
“You’re a coward and a pup. I’ll  my big brother on you, and he can thrash you  his little finger, and I’ll  him do it, too.”
“ do I  for  big brother? I’ve got a brother that’s bigger  he is—and what’s , he can throw him over  fence, too.” [ brothers  imaginary.]
“That’s a lie.”
“ saying so don’t  it so.”
Tom  a  in the   his big toe, and :
“I  you to  over , and I’ll  you  you can’t stand up. Anybody that’ll  a   steal sheep.”
The new boy stepped over promptly, and :
“Now you  you’d do it, now let’s see you do it.”
“Don’t you crowd me now; you better  out.”
“, you  you’d do it—why don’t you do it?”
“By jingo! for two cents I  do it.”
The new boy  two broad coppers out of his pocket and   out  derision. Tom struck  to the ground. In an instant    rolling and tumbling in the , gripped together  ; and for the space of a minute  tugged and  at each other’s  and clothes, punched and scratched each other’s , and covered themselves   and glory. Presently the confusion  , and through the fog of battle Tom appeared, seated astride the new boy, and pounding him  his fists. “Holler ’nuff!”  he.
The boy only struggled to  himself. He was crying—mainly  .
“Holler ’nuff!”—and the pounding  on.
At  the stranger got out a smothered “’Nuff!” and Tom let him up and :
“Now that’ll learn you. Better  out who you’re fooling   .”
The new boy  off brushing the   his clothes, sobbing, snuffling, and occasionally looking  and shaking his  and threatening  he would do to Tom the “  he caught him out.” To which Tom responded  jeers, and started off in  feather, and as  as his  was turned the new boy snatched up a stone, threw it and hit him between the shoulders and  turned  and ran  an antelope. Tom chased the traitor , and  found out where he lived. He   a position at the  for  , daring the enemy to  outside, but the enemy only  faces at him through the window and declined. At  the enemy’s mother appeared, and called Tom a bad, vicious, vulgar child, and ordered him away. So he  away; but he  he “’lowed” to “lay” for  boy.
He got  pretty   night, and  he climbed cautiously in at the window, he uncovered an ambuscade, in the person of his aunt; and  she saw the state his clothes  in her resolution to  his Saturday holiday into captivity at  labor became adamantine in its firmness.
CHAPTER II
SATURDAY morning was , and all the summer world was bright and fresh, and brimming  . There was a  in every heart; and if the heart was young the music issued at the . There was cheer in every  and a spring in every . The locust-trees  in bloom and the fragrance of the blossoms filled the air. Cardiff , beyond the village and above it, was green  vegetation and it lay  far enough away to  a Delectable , dreamy, reposeful, and inviting.
Tom appeared on the sidewalk  a bucket of whitewash and a -handled brush. He surveyed the fence, and all gladness  him and a  melancholy settled  upon his spirit. Thirty yards of board fence   .  to him seemed hollow, and existence but a burden. Sighing, he dipped his brush and passed it along the topmost plank; repeated the operation; did it again; compared the insignificant whitewashed streak  the far-reaching continent of unwhitewashed fence, and sat  on a -box discouraged. Jim  skipping out at the   a tin , and singing Buffalo . Bringing water  the   had always  hateful  in Tom’s eyes, before, but now it did not strike him so. He remembered  there was company at the . White, mulatto, and negro  and girls  always there waiting their turns, resting, trading playthings, quarrelling, fighting, skylarking. And he remembered  although the  was only a hundred and fifty yards off, Jim never got   a bucket of water under an —and even  somebody generally had to go after him. Tom :
“Say, Jim, I’ll fetch the water if you’ll whitewash .”
Jim shook his  and :
“Can’t,  Tom. Ole missis, she  me I got to go an’ git dis water an’ not  foolin’ roun’ wid anybody. She say she spec’  Tom gwine to ax me to whitewash, an’ so she  me go ’long an’ ’tend to my own business—she ’lowed she’d ’tend to de whitewashin’.”
“Oh, never you   she , Jim. That’s the way she always talks. Gimme the bucket—I won’t be  only a a minute. She won’t ever .”
“Oh, I dasn’t,  Tom. Ole missis she’d  an’ tar de  off’n me. ’Deed she would.”
“She! She never licks anybody—whacks ’em over the   her thimble—and who cares for , I’d  to . She talks awful, but  don’t —anyways it don’t if she don’t cry. Jim, I’ll  you a marvel. I’ll  you a white alley!”
Jim began to waver.
“White alley, Jim! And it’s a bully taw.”
“My! Dat’s a mighty gay marvel, I  you! But  Tom I’s powerful ’fraid ole missis—”
“And besides, if you  I’ll  you my  toe.”
Jim was only human— attraction was too  for him. He put  his ,  the white alley, and  over the toe  absorbing interest while the bandage was being unwound. In another moment he was flying  the street  his  and a tingling , Tom was whitewashing  vigor, and Aunt Polly was retiring  the field  a slipper in her  and triumph in her eye.
But Tom’s energy did not . He began to think of the fun he had planned for  day, and his sorrows multiplied.  the   would  tripping along on all sorts of delicious expeditions, and  would  a world of fun of him for having to —the  thought of it burnt him  . He got out his worldly wealth and examined it— of , marbles, and trash; enough to buy an exchange of , maybe, but not  enough to buy so  as  an  of  freedom. So he returned his straitened means to his pocket, and  up the idea of trying to buy the . At   and hopeless moment an inspiration burst upon him! Nothing   a great, magnificent inspiration.
He  up his brush and  tranquilly to . Ben Rogers  in sight presently—the  boy, of all , whose ridicule he had  dreading. Ben’s  was the hop--and-—proof enough  his heart was light and his anticipations . He was eating an apple, and giving a , melodious whoop, at intervals, followed by a -toned --, --, for he was personating a steamboat. As he  , he slackened speed,  the middle of the street, leaned far over to starboard and rounded to ponderously and  laborious  and circumstance—for he was personating the Big Missouri, and considered himself to be drawing   of water. He was  and captain and engine-bells combined, so he had to imagine himself standing on his own hurricane- giving the orders and executing :
“ her, sir! -a--!” The headway ran almost out, and he  up slowly toward the sidewalk.
“ up to ! -a--!” His arms straightened and stiffened  his sides.
“Set her  on the stabboard! -a--! ! ch--wow! !” His right , -, describing stately circles—for it was representing a forty- wheel.
“Let her go  on the labboard! -a--! -ch--!” The   began to describe circles.
“ the stabboard! -a--!  the labboard!  ahead on the stabboard!  her! Let  outside  over ! -a--! -ow-ow! Get out  -! lively now! —out   spring-—what’re you about there!  a  round  stump  the bight of it! Stand by  stage, now—let her go!   the engines, sir! -a--! ! S’H'T! !” (trying the gauge-cocks).
Tom  on whitewashing— no attention to the steamboat. Ben stared a moment and  : “Hi-Yi! You’re up a stump, ain’t you!”
No answer. Tom surveyed his  touch  the eye of an artist,  he  his brush another gentle sweep and surveyed the result, as before. Ben ranged up alongside of him. Tom’s mouth watered for the apple, but he stuck to his . Ben :
“Hello, old , you got to , hey?”
Tom wheeled suddenly and :
“Why, it’s you, Ben! I warn’t noticing.”
“Say—I’m going in a-swimming, I am. Don’t you  you could? But of course you’d druther —wouldn’t you? Course you would!”
Tom contemplated the boy a bit, and :
“ do you  ?”
“Why, ain’t  ?”
Tom resumed his whitewashing, and answered carelessly:
“, maybe it is, and maybe it ain’t. All I , is, it suits Tom Sawyer.”
“Oh , now, you don’t  to let on  you  it?”
The brush continued to .
“ it? , I don’t see why I oughtn’t to  it.  a boy get a chance to whitewash a fence every day?”
 put the thing in a new light. Ben stopped nibbling his apple. Tom swept his brush daintily  and forth—stepped  to  the effect—added a touch  and there—criticised the effect again—Ben watching every  and getting  and  interested,  and  absorbed. Presently he :
“Say, Tom, let me whitewash a little.”
Tom considered, was about to consent; but he altered his :
“No—no—I reckon it wouldn’t hardly do, Ben. You see, Aunt Polly’s awful particular about  fence—right  on the street, you —but if it was the  fence I wouldn’t  and she wouldn’t. Yes, she’s awful particular about  fence; it’s got to be   careful; I reckon there ain’t one boy in a thousand, maybe two thousand,  can do it the way it’s got to be .”
“No—is  so? Oh , now—lemme  try. Only  a little—I’d let you, if you was me, Tom.”
“Ben, I’d  to, honest injun; but Aunt Polly—, Jim wanted to do it, but she wouldn’t let him; Sid wanted to do it, and she wouldn’t let Sid. Now don’t you see how I’m fixed? If you was to tackle  fence and anything was to happen to it—”
“Oh, shucks, I’ll be  as careful. Now lemme try. Say—I’ll  you the  of my apple.”
“, —No, Ben, now don’t. I’m afeard—”
“I’ll  you all of it!”
Tom  up the brush  reluctance in his , but alacrity in his heart. And while the  steamer Big Missouri worked and sweated in the sun, the retired artist sat on a barrel in the shade close by, dangled his , munched his apple, and planned the slaughter of  innocents. There was no  of material;  happened along every little while;   to , but remained to whitewash. By the  Ben was fagged out, Tom had traded the  chance to Billy Fisher for a , in  repair; and  he played out, Johnny Miller bought in for a  rat and a string to swing it —and so on, and so on,  after . And  the middle of the afternoon ,  being a  poverty-stricken boy in the morning, Tom was literally rolling in wealth. He had besides the things before mentioned, twelve marbles,  of a -, a piece of  bottle-glass to  through, a spool cannon, a key  wouldn’t unlock anything, a fragment of chalk, a glass stopper of a decanter, a tin soldier, a couple of tadpoles, six -crackers, a kitten  only one eye, a brass -, a dog-collar—but no dog—the handle of a knife,  pieces of orange-, and a dilapidated old window .
He had had a , , idle  all the while—plenty of company—and the fence had three coats of whitewash on it! If he hadn’t run out of whitewash he would  bankrupted every boy in the village.
Tom  to himself  it was not  a hollow world, after all. He had discovered a great law of human action, without knowing it—namely,  in order to  a man or a boy covet a thing, it is only necessary to  the thing difficult to attain. If he had  a great and  philosopher,  the writer of  , he would now  comprehended   consists of whatever a  is obliged to do, and   consists of whatever a  is not obliged to do. And  would  him to understand why constructing artificial flowers or performing on a tread- is , while rolling ten- or climbing  Blanc is only amusement. There are wealthy gentlemen in England who drive -horse passenger-coaches twenty or thirty miles on a daily , in the summer, because the privilege costs  considerable money; but if   offered wages for the service,  would  it into  and   would resign.
The boy mused awhile over the substantial change which had taken place in his worldly circumstances, and  wended toward headquarters to report.
CHAPTER III
TOM presented himself before Aunt Polly, who was sitting by an open window in a pleasant rearward apartment, which was bedroom, breakfast-, dining-, and library, combined. The balmy summer air, the restful quiet, the odor of the flowers, and the drowsing murmur of the  had had their effect, and she was nodding over her knitting—for she had no company but the cat, and it was asleep in her lap. Her spectacles  propped up on her   for safety. She had thought  of course Tom had deserted  ago, and she wondered at seeing him place himself in her power again in  intrepid way. He : “Mayn’t I go and  now, aunt?”
“, a’ready? How   you ?”
“It’s all , aunt.”
“Tom, don’t lie to me—I can’t  it.”
“I ain’t, aunt; it is all .”
Aunt Polly placed small trust in  evidence. She  out to see for herself; and she would   content to  twenty per . of Tom’s statement .  she found the entire fence white-washed, and not only whitewashed but elaborately coated and recoated, and even a streak added to the ground, her astonishment was almost unspeakable. She :
“, I never! There’s no getting round it, you can   you’re a  to, Tom.” And  she diluted the compliment by adding, “But it’s powerful seldom you’re a  to, I’m bound to say. , go ’long and ; but  you get    in a , or I’ll tan you.”
She was so overcome by the splendor of his achievement  she  him into the closet and selected a choice apple and delivered it to him, along  an improving lecture upon the added value and flavor a treat  to itself  it  without sin through virtuous effort. And while she closed  a happy Scriptural flourish, he “hooked” a doughnut.
 he skipped out, and saw Sid  starting up the outside stairway  led to the  rooms on the second floor. Clods  handy and the air was  of  in a twinkling.  raged around Sid  a -storm; and before Aunt Polly could collect her surprised faculties and sally to the rescue, six or seven clods had taken personal effect, and Tom was over the fence and . There was a , but as a general thing he was too crowded for  to  use of it. His  was at peace, now  he had settled  Sid for calling attention to his black thread and getting him into trouble.
Tom skirted the block, and  round into a muddy alley  led by the  of his aunt’s cow-stable. He presently got safely beyond the reach of capture and punishment, and hastened toward the public square of the village, where two “military” companies of  had met for conflict, according to previous appointment. Tom was General of one of these armies, Joe Harper (a bosom friend) General of the other. These two great commanders did not condescend to fight in person— being better suited to the still smaller fry—but sat together on an eminence and conducted the field operations by orders delivered through aides-de-. Tom’s army won a great victory, after a  and -fought battle.  the   counted, prisoners exchanged, the terms of the  disagreement agreed upon, and the day for the necessary battle appointed; after which the armies  into  and marched away, and Tom turned homeward alone.
As he was passing by the house where  Thatcher lived, he saw a new  in the garden—a lovely little -eyed creature  yellow  plaited into two -tails, white summer frock and embroidered pan-talettes. The fresh-crowned   without firing a . A certain Amy Lawrence vanished out of his heart and  not even a memory of herself behind. He had thought he loved her to distraction; he had regarded his passion as adoration; and behold it was only a  little evanescent partiality. He had  months winning her; she had confessed hardly a  ago; he had  the happiest and the proudest boy in the world only seven short , and  in one instant of  she had  out of his heart  a casual stranger whose visit is .
He worshipped  new angel  furtive eye,  he saw  she had discovered him;  he pretended he did not  she was present, and began to “ off” in all sorts of absurd boyish , in order to win her admiration. He  up  grotesque foolishness for  ; but by-and-by, while he was in the midst of  dangerous gymnastic performances, he glanced aside and saw  the little  was wending her way toward the house. Tom  up to the fence and leaned on it, grieving, and hoping she would tarry yet awhile longer. She halted a moment on the steps and  moved toward the . Tom heaved a great  as she put her  on the threshold. But his  lit up, right away, for she tossed a pansy over the fence a moment before she disappeared.
The boy ran around and stopped within a  or two of the flower, and  shaded his eyes  his  and began to   street as if he had discovered something of interest going on in  direction. Presently he picked up a straw and began trying to balance it on his ,  his  tilted far ; and as he moved   to , in his efforts, he edged nearer and nearer toward the pansy; finally his   rested upon it, his pliant  closed upon it, and he hopped away  the treasure and disappeared round the corner. But only for a minute—only while he could button the flower inside his jacket,  his heart—or  his stomach, possibly, for he was not  posted in anatomy, and not hypercritical, anyway.
He returned, now, and  about the fence  nightfall, “showing off,” as before; but the  never exhibited herself again, though Tom comforted himself a little  the   she had    window, meantime, and  aware of his attentions. Finally he strode  reluctantly,  his    of visions.
All through supper his spirits  so   his aunt wondered “ had got into the child.” He  a  scolding about clodding Sid, and did not  to  it in the least. He tried to steal sugar under his aunt’s  , and got his knuckles rapped for it. He :
“Aunt, you don’t whack Sid  he takes it.”
“, Sid don’t torment a  the way you do. You’d be always into  sugar if I warn’t watching you.”
Presently she stepped into the kitchen, and Sid, happy in his immunity, reached for the sugar-—a  of glorying over Tom which was wellnigh unbearable. But Sid’s fingers slipped and the  dropped and broke. Tom was in ecstasies. In  ecstasies  he even controlled his tongue and was silent. He  to himself  he would not speak a , even  his aunt  in, but would sit perfectly still  she asked who did the mischief; and  he would , and there would be nothing so  in the world as to see  pet model “catch it.” He was so brimful of exultation  he could hardly  himself  the old    and stood above the wreck discharging lightnings of wrath  over her spectacles. He  to himself, “Now it’s coming!” And the  instant he was sprawling on the floor! The potent  was uplifted to strike again  Tom cried out:
“ on, now,  ’er you belting me for?—Sid broke it!”
Aunt Polly paused, perplexed, and Tom looked for healing . But  she got her tongue again, she only :
“Umf! , you didn’t get a  amiss, I reckon. You  into  other audacious mischief  I wasn’t around,  enough.”
 her conscience reproached her, and she yearned to say something  and loving; but she judged   would be construed into a confession  she had  in the wrong, and discipline forbade . So she  silence, and  about her affairs  a troubled heart. Tom sulked in a corner and exalted his . He   in her heart his aunt was on her knees to him, and he was morosely gratified by the consciousness of it. He would  out no signals, he would  notice of . He   a yearning glance  upon him, now and , through a  of tears, but he refused recognition of it.

And he pictured himself brought   the river, ,  his curls all wet, and his  heart at . How she would throw herself upon him, and how her tears would   , and her   God to  her  her boy and she would never, never abuse him any ! But he would lie there  and white and  no —a  little sufferer, whose griefs  at an end. He so worked upon his feelings  the pathos of these dreams,  he had to  swallowing, he was so  to choke; and his eyes  in a  of water, which overflowed  he winked, and ran  and trickled  the end of his . And  a luxury to him was  petting of his sorrows,  he could not  to  any worldly cheeriness or any grating delight intrude upon it; it was too sacred for  contact; and so, presently,  his cousin  danced in, all alive  the joy of seeing  again after an age- visit of one  to the country, he got up and moved in clouds and darkness out at one  as she brought  and sunshine in at the other.
He wandered far  the accustomed haunts of , and sought desolate places   in harmony  his spirit. A log  in the river invited him, and he seated himself on its outer edge and contemplated the dreary vastness of the stream, wishing, the while,  he could only be drowned, all at once and unconsciously, without undergoing the uncomfortable routine devised by nature.  he thought of his flower. He got it out, rumpled and wilted, and it mightily increased his dismal felicity. He wondered if she would  him if she ? Would she cry, and   she had a right to put her arms around his  and comfort him? Or would she  coldly away  all the hollow world?  picture brought  an agony of pleasurable suffering  he worked it over and over again in his  and set it up in new and varied lights,  he  it threadbare. At  he  up sighing and departed in the darkness.
About -  or ten o’clock he  along the deserted street to where the Adored Unknown lived; he paused a moment; no sound  upon his listening ear; a candle was casting a   upon the curtain of a second-story window. Was the sacred presence there? He climbed the fence, threaded his stealthy way through the plants,  he stood under  window; he looked up at it , and  emotion;  he  him  on the ground under it, disposing himself upon his ,  his hands clasped upon his breast and holding his  wilted flower. And  he would die—out in the  world,  no shelter over his homeless , no friendly  to  the death-damps  his , no loving  to  pityingly over him  the great agony . And  she would see him  she looked out upon the  morning, and oh would she  one little  upon his , lifeless , would she heave one little  to see a bright young  so rudely blighted, so untimely cut ?
The window  up, a -servant’s discordant voice profaned the  , and a deluge of water drenched the prone martyr’s remains!
The strangling  sprang up  a relieving snort. There was a  as of a missile in the air, mingled  the murmur of a curse, a sound as of shivering glass followed, and a small, vague   over the fence and  away in the gloom.
Not  after, as Tom, all undressed for bed, was surveying his drenched garments by the light of a tallow dip, Sid  up; but if he had any dim idea of making any “references to allusions,” he thought better of it and  his peace, for there was danger in Tom’s eye.
Tom turned in without the added vexation of prayers, and Sid  mental  of the omission.
CHAPTER IV
THE sun  upon a tranquil world, and beamed  upon the peaceful village  a benediction. Breakfast over, Aunt Polly had family worship: it began  a prayer built  the ground up of solid courses of Scriptural quotations, welded together  a  mortar of originality; and  the summit of  she delivered a  chapter of the Mosaic Law, as  Sinai.
 Tom girded up his loins, so to speak, and  to  to “get his verses.” Sid had learned his lesson  before. Tom  all his energies to the memorizing of  verses, and he chose  of the Sermon on the Mount, because he could  no verses   shorter. At the end of  an  Tom had a vague general idea of his lesson, but no , for his  was traversing the whole field of human thought, and his hands    distracting recreations.   his  to  him recite, and he tried to  his way through the fog:
“Blessed are the—a—a—”
“”—
“Yes—; blessed are the —a—a—”
“In spirit—”
“In spirit; blessed are the  in spirit, for ——”
“Theirs—”
“For theirs. Blessed are the  in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are   mourn, for ——”
“Sh—”
“For —a—”
“S, H, A—”
“For  S, H—Oh, I don’t   it is!”
“Shall!”
“Oh, shall! For  shall—for  shall—a—a—shall mourn—a—a—blessed are   shall— —a—  shall mourn, for  shall—a—shall ? Why don’t you  me, ?— do you  to be so  for?”
“Oh, Tom, you  thick-headed thing, I’m not teasing you. I wouldn’t do . You  go and learn it again. Don’t you be discouraged, Tom, you’ll manage it—and if you do, I’ll  you something ever so . There, now, that’s a  boy.”
“All right!  is it, ,  me  it is.”
“Never you , Tom. You  if I say it’s , it is .”
“You bet you that’s so, . All right, I’ll tackle it again.”
And he did “tackle it again”—and under the double pressure of curiosity and prospective  he did it   spirit  he accomplished a shining success.   him a brand-new “Barlow” knife worth twelve and a  cents; and the convulsion of delight  swept his system shook him to his foundations. , the knife would not cut anything, but it was a “-enough” Barlow, and there was inconceivable grandeur in —though where the Western  ever got the idea   a weapon could possibly be counterfeited to its injury is an imposing mystery and  always remain so, perhaps. Tom contrived to scarify the cupboard  it, and was arranging to begin on the bureau,  he was called off to dress for Sunday-school.

But  removed the towel and :
“Now ain’t you ashamed, Tom. You mustn’t be so bad. Water won’t  you.”
Tom was a trifle disconcerted. The basin was refilled, and   he stood over it a little while, gathering resolution;  in a big breath and began.  he entered the kitchen presently,   eyes  and groping for the towel  his hands, an honorable testimony of  and water was dripping  his . But  he emerged  the towel, he was not yet satisfactory, for the clean territory stopped short at his  and his ,  a ; below and beyond   there was a  expanse of unirrigated   spread downward in front and backward around his .   him in , and  she was   him he was a man and a brother, without distinction of color, and his saturated  was neatly brushed, and its short curls wrought into a dainty and symmetrical general effect.

The  “put him to rights” after he had dressed himself; she buttoned his  roundabout up to his , turned his  shirt collar  over his shoulders, brushed him off and crowned him  his speckled straw hat. He now looked exceedingly improved and uncomfortable. He was fully as uncomfortable as he looked; for there was a restraint about whole clothes and cleanliness  galled him. He hoped   would forget his shoes, but the  was blighted; she coated  thoroughly  tallow, as was the custom, and brought  out. He  his temper and  he was always being  to do everything he didn’t  to do. But  , persuasively:
“Please, Tom—that’s a  boy.”
So he got into the shoes snarling.  was  ready, and the three children set out for Sunday-school—a place  Tom hated  his whole heart; but Sid and    of it.
Sabbath-school hours    to - ten; and  church service. Two of the children always remained for the sermon voluntarily, and the other always remained too—for stronger reasons. The church’s -backed, uncushioned  would  about three hundred persons; the edifice was but a small, plain affair,  a  of  board -box on top of it for a steeple. At the  Tom dropped  a  and accosted a Sunday-dressed comrade:
“Say, Billy, got a yaller ticket?”
“Yes.”
“What’ll you  for her?”
“What’ll you ?”
“Piece of lickrish and a -.”
“ see ’em.”
Tom exhibited.   satisfactory, and the property changed hands.  Tom traded a couple of white alleys for three red tickets, and  small trifle or other for a couple of  ones. He waylaid other  as  , and  on buying tickets of various colors ten or fifteen minutes longer. He entered the church, now,  a swarm of clean and noisy  and girls, proceeded to his  and started a quarrel  the first boy   handy. The teacher, a grave, elderly man, interfered;  turned his  a moment and Tom pulled a boy’s  in the  bench, and was absorbed in his   the boy turned around; stuck a pin in another boy, presently, in order to  him say “Ouch!” and got a new reprimand  his teacher. Tom’s whole class  of a pattern—restless, noisy, and troublesome.    to recite their lessons, not one of   his verses perfectly, but had to be prompted all along. However,  worried through, and each got his reward—in small  tickets, each  a passage of Scripture on it; each  ticket was pay for two verses of the recitation. Ten  tickets equalled a red one, and could be exchanged for it; ten red tickets equalled a yellow one; for ten yellow tickets the superintendent  a  plainly bound Bible (worth forty cents in those easy times) to the pupil. How  of my readers would  the industry and application to memorize two thousand verses, even for a  Bible? And yet  had acquired two Bibles in  way—it was the patient  of two years—and a boy of German parentage had won  or . He once recited three thousand verses without stopping; but the strain upon his mental faculties was too great, and he was little better  an idiot   day forth—a grievous misfortune for the school, for on great occasions, before company, the superintendent (as Tom expressed it) had always   boy  out and “spread himself.” Only the older pupils managed to  their tickets and stick to their tedious   enough to get a Bible, and so the delivery of one of these prizes was a  and noteworthy circumstance; the successful pupil was so great and conspicuous for  day  on the  every scholar’s heart was fired  a fresh ambition  often lasted a couple of weeks. It is possible  Tom’s mental stomach had never really hungered for one of those prizes, but unquestionably his entire being had for  a day longed for the glory and the eclat    it.
In due course the superintendent stood up in front of the pulpit,  a closed - in his  and his forefinger inserted between its leaves, and commanded attention.  a Sunday-school superintendent makes his customary little speech, a - in the  is as necessary as is the inevitable sheet of music in the  of a singer who stands forward on the platform and sings a  at a concert—though why, is a mystery: for neither the - nor the sheet of music is ever referred to by the sufferer.  superintendent was a  creature of thirty-,  a sandy goatee and short sandy ; he  a stiff standing-collar whose upper edge almost reached his ears and whose sharp points curved forward abreast the corners of his mouth—a fence  compelled a straight lookout ahead, and a turning of the whole   a   was required; his  was propped on a spreading cravat which was as broad and as  as a -, and had fringed ends; his    turned sharply up, in the fashion of the day,  sleigh-runners—an effect patiently and laboriously produced by the young men by sitting  their  pressed against a  for hours together. Mr. Walters was  earnest of , and  sincere and honest at heart; and he  sacred things and places in  reverence, and so separated   worldly matters,  unconsciously to himself his Sunday-school voice had acquired a peculiar intonation which was wholly absent on -. He began after  fashion:
“Now, children, I  you all to sit up  as straight and pretty as you can and  me all  attention for a minute or two. There— is it.  is the way  little  and girls should do. I see one little  who is looking out of the window—I am afraid she thinks I am out there somewhere—perhaps up in one of the trees making a speech to the little birds. [Applausive titter.] I  to  you how  it makes me  to see so  bright, clean little faces assembled in a place  , learning to do right and be .” And so forth and so on. It is not necessary to set  the  of the oration. It was of a pattern which  not , and so it is familiar to us all.
The latter third of the speech was marred by the resumption of fights and other recreations among certain of the bad , and by fidgetings and whisperings  extended far and , washing even to the bases of isolated and incorruptible rocks  Sid and . But now every sound ceased suddenly,  the subsidence of Mr. Walters’ voice, and the conclusion of the speech was received  a burst of silent gratitude.
A   of the whispering had  occasioned by an event which was  or  —the entrance of visitors: lawyer Thatcher, accompanied by a  feeble and aged man; a , portly, middle-aged gentleman  iron- ; and a dignified  who was doubtless the latter’s . The  was leading a child. Tom had  restless and  of chafings and repinings; conscience-smitten, too—he could not  Amy Lawrence’s eye, he could not brook her loving . But  he saw  small newcomer his  was all ablaze  bliss in a moment. The  moment he was “showing off”  all his might—cuffing , pulling , making faces—in a , using every art  seemed likely to fascinate a  and win her applause. His exaltation had but one alloy—the memory of his humiliation in  angel’s garden—and  record in  was  washing out, under the waves of happiness   sweeping over it now.
The visitors  given the highest  of honor, and as  as Mr. Walters’ speech was finished, he introduced  to the school. The middle-aged man turned out to be a prodigious personage—no  a one  the county judge—altogether the  august creation these children had ever looked upon—and  wondered   of material he was  of—and   wanted to  him , and   afraid he might, too. He was  Constantinople, twelve miles away—so he had travelled, and  the world—these  eyes had looked upon the county court-house—which was  to  a tin . The awe which these reflections inspired was attested by the impressive silence and the ranks of staring eyes.  was the great Judge Thatcher, brother of their own lawyer.  Thatcher immediately  forward, to be familiar  the great man and be envied by the school. It would   music to his  to  the whisperings:
“ at him, Jim!  a going up there. Say—!  a going to shake hands  him—he is shaking hands  him! By jings, don’t you  you was ?”
Mr. Walters  to “showing off,”  all sorts of official bustlings and activities, giving orders, delivering judgments, discharging directions , there, everywhere  he could  a target. The librarian “showed off”—running hither and thither  his arms  of books and making a  of the splutter and   insect authority delights in. The young  teachers “showed off”—bending sweetly over pupils   lately being boxed, lifting pretty warning fingers at bad little  and patting  ones lovingly. The young gentlemen teachers “showed off”  small scoldings and other little displays of authority and  attention to discipline—and  of the teachers, of  sexes, found business up at the library, by the pulpit; and it was business  frequently had to be  over again two or three times (  seeming vexation). The little girls “showed off” in various , and the little  “showed off”   diligence  the air was thick  paper  and the murmur of scufflings. And above it all the great man sat and beamed a majestic judicial smile upon all the house, and warmed himself in the sun of his own grandeur—for he was “showing off,” too.
There was only one thing wanting to  Mr. Walters’ ecstasy complete, and  was a chance to deliver a Bible-prize and exhibit a prodigy. Several pupils had a few yellow tickets, but  had enough—he had  around among the  pupils inquiring. He would  given worlds, now, to   German lad  again  a sound .
And now at  moment,   was , Tom Sawyer  forward   yellow tickets,  red tickets, and ten  ones, and demanded a Bible.  was a thunderbolt out of a clear sky. Walters was not expecting an application   source for the  ten years. But there was no getting around it—  the certified checks, and    for their . Tom was therefore elevated to a place  the Judge and the other elect, and the great  was announced  headquarters. It was the  stunning surprise of the decade, and so profound was the sensation  it lifted the new  up to the judicial one’s altitude, and the school had two marvels to  upon in place of one. The   all eaten up  envy—but those  suffered the bitterest pangs  those who perceived too    themselves had contributed to  hated splendor by trading tickets to Tom for the wealth he had amassed in selling whitewashing privileges. These despised themselves, as being the dupes of a  fraud, a guileful snake in the grass.
The prize was delivered to Tom  as  effusion as the superintendent could  up under the circumstances; but it lacked somewhat of the  , for the  fellow’s instinct taught him  there was a mystery   could not   the light, perhaps; it was simply preposterous   boy had warehoused two thousand sheaves of Scriptural wisdom on his premises—a dozen would strain his capacity, without a doubt.
Amy Lawrence was proud and , and she tried to  Tom see it in her —but he wouldn’t . She wondered;  she was  a grain troubled;  a dim suspicion  and — again; she watched; a furtive glance  her worlds—and  her heart broke, and she was jealous, and angry, and the tears  and she hated everybody. Tom  of all (she thought).
Tom was introduced to the Judge; but his tongue was , his breath would hardly , his heart quaked—partly because of the awful greatness of the man, but mainly because he was her parent. He would  liked to   and worship him, if it  in the . The Judge put his  on Tom’s  and called him a  little man, and asked him  his  was. The boy stammered, gasped, and got it out:
“Tom.”
“Oh, no, not Tom—it is—”
“Thomas.”
“Ah, that’s it. I thought there was  to it, maybe. That’s  . But you’ve another one I daresay, and you’ll  it to me, won’t you?”

“Thomas Sawyer—sir.”
“That’s it! That’s a  boy.  boy. , manly little fellow. Two thousand verses is a great —,  great .

And now you wouldn’t  telling me and    of the things you’ve learned—no, I  you wouldn’t—for we are proud of little   learn. Now, no doubt you  the names of all the twelve disciples. Won’t you  us the names of the first two   appointed?”
Tom was tugging at a button- and looking sheepish. He blushed, now, and his eyes . Mr. Walters’ heart  within him. He  to himself, it is not possible  the boy can answer the simplest question—why did the Judge ask him? Yet he  obliged to speak up and say:
“Answer the gentleman, Thomas—don’t be afraid.”
Tom still  .
“Now I  you’ll  me,”  the . “The names of the first two disciples —”
“David And Goliah!”
Let us  the curtain of charity over the  of the scene.
CHAPTER V
ABOUT - ten the cracked  of the small church began to , and presently the people began to gather for the morning sermon. The Sunday-school children distributed themselves about the house and occupied   their parents, so as to be under supervision. Aunt Polly , and Tom and Sid and  sat  her—Tom being placed  the aisle, in order  he might be as far away  the open window and the seductive outside summer scenes as possible. The crowd filed up the aisles: the aged and needy postmaster, who had  better ; the mayor and his —for  had a mayor there, among other unnecessaries; the justice of the peace; the widow Douglass, , smart, and forty, a generous, -hearted  and -to-do, her  mansion the only palace in the , and the  hospitable and  the  lavish in the matter of festivities  St. Petersburg could boast; the  and venerable Major and Mrs. ; lawyer Riverson, the new notable  a distance;  the belle of the village, followed by a troop of - and ribbon-decked young heart-breakers;  all the young clerks in  in a —for  had stood in the vestibule sucking their -heads, a circling  of oiled and simpering admirers,  the   had run their gantlet; and  of all  the Model Boy, Willie Mufferson, taking as heedful  of his mother as if she  cut glass. He always brought his mother to church, and was the pride of all the matrons. The  all hated him, he was so . And besides, he had  “thrown up to ” so . His white handkerchief was hanging out of his pocket behind, as usual on Sundays—accidentally. Tom had no handkerchief, and he looked upon  who had as snobs.
The congregation being fully assembled, now, the   once , to  laggards and stragglers, and  a solemn   upon the church which was only broken by the tittering and whispering of the choir in the gallery. The choir always tittered and whispered all through service. There was once a church choir  was not ill-, but I  forgotten where it was, now. It was a great  years ago, and I can scarcely remember anything about it, but I think it was in  foreign country.
The minister  out the , and  it through  a relish, in a peculiar style which was  admired in   of the country. His voice began on a medium key and climbed steadily up  it reached a certain point, where it   strong emphasis upon the topmost  and  plunged  as if  a spring-board:
Shall I be car-ri-ed toe the skies, on flow’ry  of ease,
Whilst others fight to win the prize, and  thro’ blood-y ?
He was regarded as a wonderful reader. At church “sociables” he was always called upon to  poetry; and  he was through, the ladies would  up their hands and let   helplessly in their , and “” their eyes, and shake their heads, as  as to say, “Words cannot express it; it is too beautiful, TOO beautiful for  mortal earth.”
After the  had  , the Rev. Mr. Sprague turned himself into a bulletin-board, and  off “notices” of meetings and societies and things  it seemed  the  would stretch out to the crack of —a queer custom which is still  up in America, even in cities, away  in  age of abundant newspapers. Often, the  there is to justify a traditional custom, the harder it is to get rid of it.
And now the minister prayed. A , generous prayer it was, and  into details: it pleaded for the church, and the little children of the church; for the other churches of the village; for the village itself; for the county; for the State; for the State officers; for the United States; for the churches of the United States; for Congress; for the President; for the officers of the Government; for  sailors, tossed by stormy ; for the oppressed millions groaning under the  of European monarchies and Oriental despotisms; for  as  the light and the  tidings, and yet  not eyes to see nor ears to  withal; for the heathen in the far islands of the sea; and closed  a supplication  the words he was about to speak might  grace and favor, and be as   in fertile ground, yielding in  a grateful harvest of . Amen.
There was a rustling of dresses, and the standing congregation sat . The boy whose history   relates did not enjoy the prayer, he only endured it—if he even did  . He was restive all through it; he  tally of the details of the prayer, unconsciously—for he was not listening, but he  the ground of old, and the clergyman’s regular route over it—and  a little trifle of new matter was interlarded, his ear detected it and his whole nature resented it; he considered additions unfair, and scoundrelly. In the midst of the prayer a fly had lit on the  of the pew in front of him and tortured his spirit by calmly rubbing its hands together, embracing its   its arms, and polishing it so vigorously  it seemed to almost  company  the , and the slender thread of a  was exposed to ; scraping its wings  its   and smoothing  to its  as if  had  -tails; going through its whole toilet as tranquilly as if it  it was perfectly . As indeed it was; for as sorely as Tom’s hands itched to  for it  did not —he believed his  would be instantly destroyed if he did  a thing while the prayer was going on. But  the closing sentence his  began to curve and steal forward; and the instant the “Amen” was out the fly was a prisoner of war. His aunt detected the act and  him let it go.
The minister  out his  and droned along monotonously through an argument  was so prosy   a  by and by began to nod—and yet it was an argument  dealt in limitless  and brimstone and thinned the predestined elect  to a company so small as to be hardly worth the saving. Tom counted the pages of the sermon; after church he always  how  pages there had , but he seldom  anything else about the discourse. However,   he was really interested for a little while. The minister  a grand and moving picture of the assembling together of the world’s hosts at the millennium  the  and the  should lie  together and a little child should  . But the pathos, the lesson, the moral of the great spectacle   upon the boy; he only thought of the conspicuousness of the principal character before the on-looking nations; his  lit  the thought, and he  to himself  he wished he could be  child, if it was a  .
Now he lapsed into suffering again, as the dry argument was resumed. Presently he bethought him of a treasure he had and got it out. It was a large black beetle  formidable —a “pinchbug,” he called it. It was in a percussion-cap box. The first thing the beetle did was to  him by the finger. A natural fillip followed, the beetle  floundering into the aisle and lit on its , and the  finger  into the boy’s mouth. The beetle lay there working its helpless , unable to  over. Tom eyed it, and longed for it; but it was  out of his reach. Other people uninterested in the sermon found relief in the beetle, and  eyed it too. Presently a vagrant poodle dog  idling along, sad at heart,   the summer softness and the quiet, weary of captivity, sighing for change. He spied the beetle; the drooping  lifted and wagged. He surveyed the prize; walked around it; smelt at it  a  distance; walked around it again;  bolder, and  a closer smell;  lifted his lip and  a gingerly snatch at it,  missing it;  another, and another; began to enjoy the diversion; subsided to his stomach  the beetle between his , and continued his experiments;  weary at , and  indifferent and absent-minded. His  nodded, and little by little his  descended and touched the enemy, who seized it. There was a sharp , a flirt of the poodle’s , and the beetle  a couple of yards away, and lit on its  once . The neighboring spectators shook  a gentle inward joy, several faces  behind  and -kerchiefs, and Tom was entirely happy. The dog looked foolish, and probably  so; but there was resentment in his heart, too, and a craving for revenge. So he  to the beetle and began a  attack on it again; jumping at it  every point of a circle, lighting  his - within an inch of the creature, making even closer snatches at it  his teeth, and jerking his   his ears flapped again. But he  tired once , after a while; tried to amuse himself  a fly but found no relief; followed an ant around,  his  close to the floor, and quickly wearied of ; yawned, sighed, forgot the beetle entirely, and sat  on it.  there was a   of agony and the poodle  sailing up the aisle; the yelps continued, and so did the dog; he crossed the house in front of the altar; he   the other aisle; he crossed before the doors; he clamored up the -stretch; his anguish   his progress,  presently he was but a woolly comet moving in its orbit  the gleam and the speed of light. At  the frantic sufferer sheered  its course, and sprang into its master’s lap; he flung it out of the window, and the voice of distress quickly thinned away and  in the distance.
By   the whole church was red-faced and suffocating  suppressed laughter, and the sermon had  to a  standstill. The discourse was resumed presently, but it   and halting, all possibility of impressiveness being at an end; for even the gravest sentiments  constantly being received  a smothered burst of unholy mirth, under cover of  remote pew-, as if the  parson had  a rarely facetious thing. It was a genuine relief to the whole congregation  the ordeal was over and the benediction pronounced.
Tom Sawyer   quite cheerful, thinking to himself  there was  satisfaction about divine service  there was a bit of variety in it. He had but one marring thought; he was willing  the dog should   his pinchbug, but he did not think it was upright in him to carry it off.
CHAPTER VI
MONDAY morning found Tom Sawyer miserable. Monday morning always found him so—because it began another week’s  suffering in school. He generally began  day  wishing he had had no intervening holiday, it  the going into captivity and fetters again so   odious.
Tom lay thinking. Presently it occurred to him  he wished he was ;  he could    school.  was a vague possibility. He canvassed his system. No ailment was found, and he investigated again.   he thought he could detect colicky symptoms, and he began to encourage   considerable . But    feeble, and presently  wholly away. He reflected further. Suddenly he discovered something. One of his upper front teeth was loose.  was lucky; he was about to begin to groan, as a “starter,” as he called it,  it occurred to him  if he  into court   argument, his aunt would  it out, and  would .

Tom moaned out:
“Oh, don’t, Sid. Don’t joggle me.”
“Why, what’s the matter, Tom? I   auntie.”
“No—never . It’ll be over by and by, maybe. Don’t  anybody.”
“But I ! Don’t groan so, Tom, it’s awful. How  you   way?”
“Hours. Ouch! Oh, don’t  so, Sid, you’ll  me.”
“Tom, why didn’t you  me sooner? Oh, Tom, don’t! It makes my flesh crawl to  you. Tom,  is the matter?”
“I forgive you everything, Sid. [Groan.] Everything you’ve ever  to me.  I’m —”
“Oh, Tom, you ain’t dying, are you? Don’t, Tom—oh, don’t. Maybe—”
“I forgive everybody, Sid. [Groan.]  ’em so, Sid. And Sid, you  my window- and my cat  one eye to  new  that’s  to , and  her—”
But Sid had snatched his clothes and . Tom was suffering in reality, now, so handsomely was his imagination working, and so his groans had gathered quite a genuine .
Sid  downstairs and :
“Oh, Aunt Polly, ! Tom’s dying!”
“Dying!”
“Yes’m. Don’t — quick!”
“Rubbage! I don’t believe it!”
But she  upstairs, nevertheless,  Sid and  at her heels. And her   white, too, and her lip trembled.  she reached the bedside she gasped out:
“You, Tom! Tom, what’s the matter  you?”
“Oh, auntie, I’m—”
“What’s the matter  you— is the matter  you, child?”
“Oh, auntie, my  toe’s mortified!”
The old    into a chair and laughed a little,  cried a little,  did  together.  restored her and she :
“Tom,  a  you did  me. Now you  up  nonsense and climb out of .”
The groans ceased and the  vanished  the toe. The boy  a little foolish, and he :
“Aunt Polly, it seemed mortified, and it  so I never minded my tooth at all.”
“ tooth, indeed! What’s the matter   tooth?”
“One of them’s loose, and it aches perfectly awful.”
“There, there, now, don’t begin  groaning again. Open  mouth. — tooth is loose, but you’re not going to die about . , get me a  thread, and a chunk of  out of the kitchen.”
Tom :
“Oh, please, auntie, don’t  it out. It don’t  any . I  I may never  if it . Please don’t, auntie. I don’t  to    school.”
“Oh, you don’t, don’t you? So all  row was because you thought you’d get to    school and go a-fishing? Tom, Tom, I  you so, and you  to try every way you can to break my old heart   outrageousness.” By   the dental instruments  ready. The old   one end of the  thread  to Tom’s tooth  a  and  the other to the bedpost.  she seized the chunk of  and suddenly thrust it almost into the boy’s . The tooth  dangling by the bedpost, now.
But all trials bring their compensations. As Tom wended to school after breakfast, he was the envy of every boy he met because the gap in his upper row of teeth enabled him to expectorate in a new and admirable way. He gathered quite a following of  interested in the exhibition; and one  had cut his finger and had  a centre of fascination and homage up to  , now found himself suddenly without an adherent, and shorn of his glory. His heart was heavy, and he   a disdain which he did not   it wasn’t anything to   Tom Sawyer; but another boy , “ grapes!” and he wandered away a dismantled .
Shortly Tom  upon the juvenile pariah of the village, Huckleberry , son of the  drunkard. Huckleberry was cordially hated and dreaded by all the mothers of the , because he was idle and lawless and vulgar and bad—and because all their children admired him so, and delighted in his forbidden society, and wished  dared to be  him. Tom was  the  of the respectable , in  he envied Huckleberry his gaudy outcast condition, and was under strict orders not to   him. So he played  him every  he got a chance. Huckleberry was always dressed in the -off clothes of -grown men, and   in perennial bloom and fluttering  . His hat was a    a  crescent lopped out of its ; his ,  he  one,  nearly to his heels and had the rearward buttons far  the ; but one suspender supported his trousers; the  of the trousers bagged low and contained nothing, the fringed  dragged in the   not rolled up.
Huckleberry  and , at his own  . He slept on doorsteps in  weather and in empty hogsheads in wet; he did not  to go to school or to church, or  any being master or obey anybody; he could go fishing or swimming  and where he chose, and  as  as it suited him; nobody forbade him to fight; he could sit up as  as he pleased; he was always the first boy   barefoot in the spring and the  to resume leather in the ; he never had to , nor put on clean clothes; he could swear wonderfully. In a , everything   to   precious  boy had. So thought every harassed, hampered, respectable boy in St. Petersburg.
Tom hailed the romantic outcast:
“Hello, Huckleberry!”
“Hello yourself, and see how you  it.”
“What’s  you got?”
“ cat.”
“Lemme see him, . My,  pretty stiff. Where’d you get him?”
“Bought him off’n a boy.”
“ did you ?”
“I  a  ticket and a bladder  I got at the slaughter-house.”
“Where’d you get the  ticket?”
“Bought it off’n Ben Rogers two weeks ago for a -stick.”
“Say— is    for, ?”
“ for?  warts .”
“No! Is  so? I  something that’s better.”
“I bet you don’t.  is it?”
“Why, spunk-water.”
“Spunk-water! I wouldn’t  a  for spunk-water.”
“You wouldn’t, wouldn’t you? D’you ever try it?”
“No, I hain’t. But Bob Tanner did.”
“Who  you so!”
“Why, he   Thatcher, and   Johnny Baker, and Johnny  Jim Hollis, and Jim  Ben Rogers, and Ben  a nigger, and the nigger  me. There now!”
“,  of it? They’ll all lie. Leastways all but the nigger. I don’t  him. But I never see a nigger  wouldn’t lie. Shucks! Now you  me how Bob Tanner  it, .”
“Why, he  and dipped his  in a rotten stump where the -water was.”
“In the daytime?”
“Certainly.”
“ his  to the stump?”
“Yes. Least I reckon so.”
“Did he say anything?”
“I don’t reckon he did. I don’t .”
“Aha!  about trying to  warts  spunk-water  a blame  way as ! Why,  ain’t a-going to do any . You got to go all by yourself, to the middle of the woods, where you  there’s a spunk-water stump, and  as it’s midnight you  up against the stump and jam   in and say:
‘Barley-, barley-, injun- shorts, Spunk-water, spunk-water, swaller these warts,’
and   away quick, eleven steps,   eyes , and   around three times and   without speaking to anybody. Because if you speak the charm’s busted.”
“,  sounds  a  way; but  ain’t the way Bob Tanner .”
“No, sir, you can bet he didn’t, becuz  the wartiest boy in  ; and he wouldn’t  a  on him if  knowed how to  spunk-water. I’ve  off thousands of warts off of my hands  way, . I   frogs so   I’ve always got considerable  warts. Sometimes I  ’em off  a .”
“Yes, bean’s . I’ve  .”
“ you? What’s  way?”
“You  and split the , and cut the  so as to get  blood, and  you put the blood on one piece of the  and  and dig a  and  it ’bout midnight at the crossroads in the  of the , and  you  up the  of the . You see  piece that’s got the blood on it   drawing and drawing, trying to fetch the other piece to it, and so  helps the blood to  the , and pretty  off she comes.”
“Yes, that’s it, —that’s it; though  you’re burying it if you say ‘ ; off ;  no  to bother me!’ it’s better. That’s the way Joe Harper , and   nearly to Coonville and  everywheres. But say—how do you  ’em   ?”
“Why, you   cat and go and get in the grave- ’long about midnight  somebody  was wicked has  buried; and  it’s midnight a devil  , or maybe two or three, but you can’t see ’em, you can only  something  the , or maybe  ’em ; and  they’re taking  feller away, you heave  cat after ’em and say, ‘Devil follow corpse, cat follow devil, warts follow cat, I’m   ye!’ That’ll fetch any .”
“Sounds right. D’you ever try it, ?”
“No, but old Mother Hopkins  me.”
“, I reckon it’s so, . Becuz  say she’s a witch.”
“Say! Why, Tom, I  she is. She witched pap. Pap  so his own . He  along one day, and he see she was a-witching him, so he  up a , and if she hadn’t dodged,  a got her. ,   night he rolled off’n a  wher’ he was a layin drunk, and broke his arm.”
“Why, that’s awful. How did he  she was a-witching him?”
“, pap can , easy. Pap     looking at you right stiddy, they’re a-witching you. Specially if  mumble. Becuz   mumble they’re saying the Lord’s Prayer backards.”
“Say, Hucky,  you going to try the cat?”
“To-night. I reckon they’ll  after old  Williams to-night.”
“But  buried him Saturday. Didn’t  get him Saturday night?”
“Why, how you ! How could their charms   midnight?—and  it’s Sunday. Devils don’t slosh around  of a Sunday, I don’t reckon.”
“I never thought of . That’s so. Lemme go  you?”
“Of course—if you ain’t afeard.”
“Afeard! ’Tain’t likely.  you ?”
“Yes—and you  , if you get a chance.  , you  me a-meowing around  old   to throwing rocks at me and  ‘  cat!’ and so I  a brick through his window—but don’t you .”
“I won’t. I couldn’t   night, becuz auntie was watching me, but I’ll   . Say—what’s ?”
“Nothing but a .”
“Where’d you get him?”
“Out in the woods.”
“What’ll you  for him?”
“I don’t . I don’t  to  him.”
“All right. It’s a mighty small , anyway.”
“Oh, anybody can run a    don’t belong to . I’m satisfied  it. It’s a  enough  for me.”

“Say, —I’ll  you my tooth for him.”

Tom got out a bit of paper and carefully unrolled it. Huckleberry viewed it wistfully. The temptation was  strong. At  he :
“Is it genuwyne?”
Tom lifted his lip and showed the vacancy.
“, all right,”  Huckleberry, “it’s a trade.”
Tom enclosed the  in the percussion-cap box  had lately  the pinchbug’s prison, and the  separated, each feeling wealthier  before.
 Tom reached the little isolated frame school-house, he strode in briskly,  the manner of one who had   all honest speed. He  his hat on a peg and flung himself into his   business- alacrity. The master, throned on  in his great splint-bottom arm-chair, was dozing, lulled by the drowsy hum of study. The interruption roused him.
“Thomas Sawyer!”
Tom    his  was pronounced in , it meant trouble.
“Sir!”
“ up . Now, sir, why are you  again, as usual?”
Tom was about to  refuge in a lie,  he saw two  tails of yellow  hanging  a   he recognized by the electric sympathy of ; and by   was the only vacant place on the girls’  of the school-house. He instantly :
“I stopped to   Huckleberry !”
The master’s pulse stood still, and he stared helplessly. The  of study ceased. The pupils wondered if  foolhardy boy had  his . The master :
“You—you did ?”
“Stopped to   Huckleberry .”
There was no mistaking the words.
“Thomas Sawyer,  is the  astounding confession I  ever listened to. No  ferule  answer for  offence.  off  jacket.”
The master’s arm performed until it was tired and the stock of switches notably diminished.  the order followed:
“Now, sir, go and sit  the girls! And let  be a warning to you.”
The titter  rippled around the  appeared to abash the boy, but in reality  result was caused rather  by his worshipful awe of his unknown idol and the dread pleasure  lay in his   fortune. He sat  upon the end of the  bench and the  hitched herself away  him  a  of her . Nudges and winks and whispers traversed the , but Tom sat still,  his arms upon the , low  before him, and seemed to study his .
By and by attention ceased  him, and the accustomed school murmur  upon the  air once . Presently the boy began to steal furtive glances at the . She observed it, “ a mouth” at him and  him the  of her  for the space of a minute.  she cautiously faced around again, a peach lay before her. She thrust it away. Tom gently put it . She thrust it away again, but   animosity. Tom patiently returned it to its place.  she let it remain. Tom scrawled on his slate, “Please  it—I got .” The  glanced at the words, but  no . Now the boy began to  something on the slate, hiding his   his  . For a  the  refused to notice; but her human curiosity presently began to manifest itself by hardly perceptible signs.

Tom partly uncovered a dismal caricature of a house  two gable ends to it and a corkscrew of smoke issuing  the chimney.  the girl’s interest began to fasten itself upon the  and she forgot everything else.  it was finished, she gazed a moment,  whispered:
“It’s — a man.”
The artist erected a man in the front ,  resembled a derrick. He could  stepped over the house; but the  was not hypercritical; she was satisfied  the monster, and whispered:

Tom  an -glass  a   and straw limbs to it and armed the spreading fingers  a portentous fan. The  :

“It’s easy,” whispered Tom, “I’ll learn you.”
“Oh,  you? ?”
“At . Do you go  to dinner?”
“I’ll  if you .”
“—that’s a whack. What’s  ?”
“Becky Thatcher. What’s yours? Oh, I . It’s Thomas Sawyer.”
“That’s the    me by. I’m Tom  I’m . You  me Tom,  you?”
“Yes.”
Now Tom began to scrawl something on the slate, hiding the words  the . But she was not backward  . She begged to see. Tom :
“Oh, it ain’t anything.”
“Yes it is.”
“No it ain’t. You don’t  to see.”
“Yes I do, indeed I do. Please let me.”
“You’ll .”
“No I won’t— and  and double  won’t.”
“You won’t  anybody at all? Ever, as  as you ?”
“No, I won’t ever  anybody. Now let me.”
“Oh, you don’t  to see!”
“Now  you treat me so, I  see.” And she put her small  upon his and a little scuffle ensued, Tom pretending to resist in earnest but letting his   by degrees  these words  revealed: “I  you.”

But although Tom’s ear tingled, his heart was jubilant.
As the school quieted  Tom  an honest effort to study, but the turmoil within him was too great. In  he  his place in the reading class and  a botch of it;  in the geography class and turned lakes into mountains, mountains into rivers, and rivers into continents,  chaos was  again;  in the spelling class, and got “turned ,” by a succession of   words,  he brought up at the  and yielded up the pewter medal which he had   ostentation for months.
CHAPTER VII
THE harder Tom tried to fasten his  on his , the  his ideas wandered. So at ,  a  and a , he  it up. It seemed to him  the  recess would never . The air was utterly . There was not a breath stirring. It was the sleepiest of sleepy . The drowsing murmur of the  and twenty studying scholars soothed the   the spell  is in the murmur of . Away off in the flaming sunshine, Cardiff  lifted its  green sides through a shimmering  of , tinted  the purple of distance; a few birds floated on    in the air; no other living thing was visible but  , and   asleep.

“Tom, you let him alone.”
“I only   to  him up a little, Joe.”
“No, sir, it ain’t ; you  let him alone.”
“Blame it, I ain’t going to  him .”
“Let him alone, I  you.”
“I won’t!”
“You shall— on my  of the .”

“Put on  bonnet and let on you’re going ; and  you get to the corner,  the  of ’em the , and   through the  and  . I’ll go the other way and  it over ’em the  way.”
So the one  off  one group of scholars, and the other  another. In a little while the two met at the bottom of the , and   reached the school  had it all to themselves.   sat together,  a slate before , and Tom  Becky the pencil and  her  in his, guiding it, and so created another surprising house.  the interest in art began to , the two  to talking.

“No! I  !”
“, I do, too— ones. But I   ones, to swing round    a string.”
“No, I don’t  for  , anyway.  I  is chewing-gum.”

“Was you ever at a circus?”  Tom.
“Yes, and my  going to  me again  , if I’m .”
“I  to the circus three or  times— of times. Church ain’t shucks to a circus. There’s things going on at a circus all the . I’m going to be a clown in a circus  I  up.”
“Oh, are you!   be . They’re so lovely, all spotted up.”
“Yes, that’s so. And  get slathers of money— a dollar a day, Ben Rogers . Say, Becky, was you ever engaged?”
“What’s ?”
“Why, engaged to be married.”
“No.”
“Would you  to?”
“I reckon so. I don’t .  is it ?”
“? Why it ain’t  anything. You only   a boy you won’t ever  anybody but him, ever ever ever, and  you  and that’s all. Anybody can do it.”
“?  do you  for?”
“Why, , you , is to—,  always do .”
“Everybody?”
“Why, yes, everybody that’s in   each other. Do you remember  I wrote on the slate?”
“Ye—yes.”
“ was it?”
“I sha’n’t  you.”
“Shall I  you?”
“Ye—yes—but  other .”
“No, now.”
“No, not now—to-morrow.”
“Oh, no, now. Please, Becky—I’ll whisper it, I’ll whisper it ever so easy.”
Becky hesitating, Tom  silence for consent, and passed his arm about her waist and whispered the  ever so softly,  his mouth close to her ear. And  he added:
“Now you whisper it to me— the .”
She resisted, for a while, and  :
“You    away so you can’t see, and  I . But you mustn’t ever  anybody— you, Tom? Now you won’t,  you?”
“No, indeed, indeed I won’t. Now, Becky.”
He turned his  away. She  timidly around  her breath stirred his curls and whispered, “I——you!”
 she sprang away and ran around and around the desks and benches,  Tom after her, and  refuge in a corner at ,  her little white apron to her . Tom clasped her about her  and pleaded:
“Now, Becky, it’s all —all over but the . Don’t you be afraid of —it ain’t anything at all. Please, Becky.” And he tugged at her apron and the hands.
By and by she  up, and let her hands ; her , all glowing  the struggle,  up and submitted. Tom kissed the red  and :
“Now it’s all , Becky. And always after , you , you ain’t ever to  anybody but me, and you ain’t ever to marry anybody but me, ever never and forever.  you?”
“No, I’ll never  anybody but you, Tom, and I’ll never marry anybody but you—and you ain’t to ever marry anybody but me, either.”
“Certainly. Of course. That’s  of it. And always coming to school or  we’re going , you’re to   me,  there ain’t anybody looking—and you choose me and I choose you at parties, because that’s the way you do  you’re engaged.”
“It’s so . I never heard of it before.”
“Oh, it’s ever so gay! Why, me and Amy Lawrence—”
The big eyes  Tom his blunder and he stopped, confused.
“Oh, Tom!  I ain’t the first you’ve ever  engaged to!”
The child began to cry. Tom :
“Oh, don’t cry, Becky, I don’t  for her any .”
“Yes, you do, Tom—you  you do.”
Tom tried to put his arm about her , but she pushed him away and turned her  to the , and  on crying. Tom tried again,  soothing words in his mouth, and was repulsed again.  his pride was up, and he strode away and  outside. He stood about, restless and uneasy, for a while, glancing at the , every now and , hoping she would repent and  to  him. But she did not.  he began to  badly and   he was in the wrong. It was a  struggle  him to  new advances, now, but he nerved himself to it and entered. She was still standing  there in the corner, sobbing,  her  to the . Tom’s heart smote him. He  to her and stood a moment, not knowing exactly how to proceed.  he  hesitatingly:
“Becky, I—I don’t  for anybody but you.”
No reply—but .
“Becky”—pleadingly. “Becky, won’t you say something?”
 .
Tom got out his chiefest jewel, a brass   the top of an andiron, and passed it around her so  she could see it, and :
“Please, Becky, won’t you  it?”
She struck it to the floor.  Tom marched out of the house and over the hills and far away, to return to school no   day. Presently Becky began to suspect. She ran to the ; he was not in sight; she  around to the -; he was not there.  she called:
“Tom!  , Tom!”
She listened intently, but there was no answer. She had no companions but silence and loneliness. So she sat  to cry again and upbraid herself; and by   the scholars began to gather again, and she had to  her griefs and still her broken heart and  up the cross of a , dreary, aching afternoon,   among the strangers about her to exchange sorrows .
CHAPTER 
TOM dodged hither and thither through lanes until he was  out of the track of returning scholars, and   into a moody jog. He crossed a small “branch” two or three times, because of a prevailing juvenile superstition  to cross water baffled pursuit.  an  later he was disappearing behind the Douglas mansion on the summit of Cardiff , and the school-house was hardly distinguishable away off in the valley behind him. He entered a dense , picked his pathless way to the centre of it, and sat  on a mossy  under a spreading oak. There was not even a zephyr stirring; the  noonday  had even stilled the songs of the birds; nature lay in a trance  was broken by no sound but the occasional far-off hammering of a -pecker, and  seemed to render the pervading silence and sense of loneliness the  profound. The boy’s  was steeped in melancholy; his feelings  in happy accord  his surroundings. He sat   his elbows on his knees and his  in his hands, meditating. It seemed to him   was but a trouble, at , and he    envied Jimmy Hodges, so lately released; it  be  peaceful, he thought, to lie and slumber and dream forever and ever,  the  whispering through the trees and caressing the grass and the flowers over the grave, and nothing to bother and grieve about, ever any . If he only had a clean Sunday-school record he could be willing to go, and be   it all. Now as to  .  had he ? Nothing. He had meant the  in the world, and  treated  a dog— a  dog. She would be sorry  day—maybe  it was too . Ah, if he could only die temporarily!
But the elastic heart of youth cannot be compressed into one constrained shape  at a . Tom presently began to drift insensibly  into the concerns of   again.  if he turned his , now, and disappeared mysteriously?  if he  away—ever so far away, into unknown countries beyond the —and never   any ! How would she  ! The idea of being a clown recurred to him now, only to  him  disgust. For frivolity and jokes and spotted tights  an offense,   intruded themselves upon a spirit  was exalted into the vague august realm of the romantic. No, he would be a soldier, and return after  years, all war- and illustrious. No—better still, he would  the Indians, and  buffaloes and go on the warpath in the mountain ranges and the trackless great plains of the Far , and away in the future   a great chief, bristling  feathers, hideous  paint, and prance into Sunday-school,  drowsy summer morning,  a blood-curdling war-whoop, and  the eyeballs of all his companions  unappeasable envy. But no, there was something gaudier even  . He would be a pirate!  was it! now his future lay plain before him, and glowing  unimaginable splendor. How his  would  the world, and  people shudder! How gloriously he would go plowing the dancing , in his , low, black-hulled racer, the Spirit of the Storm,  his grisly  flying at the ! And at the zenith of his , how he would suddenly appear at the old village and stalk into church, brown and weather-beaten, in his black velvet doublet and trunks, his great -boots, his crimson , his  bristling  horse-pistols, his crime-rusted cutlass at his , his slouch hat  waving plumes, his black  unfurled,  the skull and crossbones on it, and   swelling ecstasy the whisperings, “It’s Tom Sawyer the Pirate!—the Black Avenger of the Spanish !”
Yes, it was settled; his career was determined. He would run away   and enter upon it. He would start the   morning. Therefore he  now begin to get ready. He would collect his resources together. He  to a rotten log  at  and began to dig under one end of it  his Barlow knife. He  struck   sounded hollow. He put his  there and uttered  incantation impressively:
“ hasn’t  , ! What’s ,  !”
 he scraped away the , and exposed a  shingle. He  it up and disclosed a shapely little treasure-house whose bottom and sides  of shingles. In it lay a marble. Tom’s astonishment was bound-! He scratched his   a perplexed air, and :
“,  beats anything!”
 he tossed the marble away pettishly, and stood cogitating. The truth was,  a superstition of his had failed, , which he and all his comrades had always looked upon as infallible. If you buried a marble  certain necessary incantations, and  it alone a fortnight, and  opened the place  the incantation he had  used, you would   all the marbles you had ever  had gathered themselves together there, meantime, no matter how widely  had  separated. But now,  thing had actually and unquestionably failed. Tom’s whole structure of faith was shaken to its foundations. He had  a  heard of  thing succeeding but never of its failing before. It did not occur to him  he had tried it several times before, himself, but could never  the hiding-places afterward. He puzzled over the matter  , and finally decided   witch had interfered and broken the charm. He thought he would satisfy himself on  point; so he searched around  he found a small sandy   a little funnel-shaped depression in it. He  himself  and put his mouth close to  depression and called—
“Doodle-bug, doodle-bug,  me  I  to ! Doodle-bug, doodle-bug,  me  I  to !”
The  began to , and presently a small black bug appeared for a second and  darted under again in a fright.
“He dasn’t ! So it was a witch   it. I  knowed it.”
He   the futility of trying to contend against witches, so he  up discouraged. But it occurred to him  he might as   the marble he had  thrown away, and therefore he  and  a patient search for it. But he could not  it. Now he   to his treasure-house and carefully placed himself  as he had  standing  he tossed the marble away;  he  another marble  his pocket and tossed it in the  way, saying:
“Brother, go   brother!”
He watched where it stopped, and  there and looked. But it   fallen short or  too far; so he tried twice . The  repetition was successful. The two marbles lay within a  of each other.
  the blast of a toy tin trumpet  faintly  the green aisles of the forest. Tom flung off his jacket and trousers, turned a suspender into a , raked away  brush behind the rotten log, disclosing a  bow and arrow, a  sword and a tin trumpet, and in a moment had seized these things and bounded away, barelegged,  fluttering shirt. He presently halted under a great elm,  an answering blast, and  began to tiptoe and  warily out,  way and . He  cautiously—to an imaginary company:
“, my merry men!  hid  I .”
Now appeared Joe Harper, as airily  and elaborately armed as Tom. Tom called:
“! Who comes  into Sherwood Forest without my ?”
“Guy of Guisborne wants no man’s . Who art  ——”
“Dares to   language,”  Tom, prompting—for  talked “by the ,”  memory.
“Who art   dares to   language?”
“I, indeed! I am Robin , as thy caitiff carcase  shall .”
“ art  indeed  famous outlaw? Right gladly  I dispute   the passes of the merry .  at !”
  their  swords, dumped their other traps on the ground, struck a fencing attitude,  to , and began a grave, careful combat, “two up and two .” Presently Tom :
“Now, if you’ve got the , go it lively!”
So  “ it lively,” panting and perspiring  the . By and by Tom shouted:
“! ! Why don’t you ?”
“I sha’n’t! Why don’t you  yourself? You’re getting the worst of it.”
“Why,  ain’t anything. I can’t ;  ain’t the way it is in the . The  , ‘  one -handed stroke he   Guy of Guisborne.’ You’re to  around and let me hit you in the .”
There was no getting around the authorities, so Joe turned, received the whack and .
“Now,”  Joe, getting up, “you got to let me  you. That’s .”
“Why, I can’t do , it ain’t in the .”
“, it’s blamed —that’s all.”
“, say, Joe, you can be Friar  or  the miller’s son, and lam me  a quarter-staff; or I’ll be the Sheriff of Nottingham and you be Robin  a little while and  me.”
 was satisfactory, and so these adventures  carried out.  Tom became Robin  again, and was allowed by the treacherous nun to bleed his strength away through his neglected wound. And at  Joe, representing a whole tribe of weeping outlaws, dragged him sadly forth,  his bow into his feeble hands, and Tom , “Where  arrow falls, there   Robin  under the greenwood .”  he  the arrow and   and would  , but he lit on a nettle and sprang up too gaily for a corpse.

CHAPTER IX
AT - ,  night, Tom and Sid   to bed, as usual.   their prayers, and Sid was  asleep. Tom lay awake and waited, in restless impatience.  it seemed to him  it  be nearly daylight, he heard the clock strike ten!  was despair. He would  tossed and fidgeted, as his nerves demanded, but he was afraid he might  Sid. So he lay still, and stared up into the . Everything was dismally still. By and by, out of the stillness, little, scarcely perceptible noises began to emphasize themselves. The ticking of the clock began to bring itself into notice. Old beams began to crack mysteriously. The stairs creaked faintly. Evidently spirits  abroad. A measured, muffled snore issued  Aunt Polly’s chamber. And now the tiresome chirping of a cricket  no human ingenuity could locate, began.  the ghastly ticking of a death-watch in the  at the bed’s   Tom shudder—it meant  somebody’s   numbered.  the  of a far-off dog  on the night air, and was answered by a fainter   a remoter distance. Tom was in an agony. At  he was satisfied   had ceased and eternity begun; he began to , in spite of himself; the clock chimed eleven, but he did not  it. And  there , mingling  his -formed dreams, a  melancholy caterwauling. The raising of a neighboring window disturbed him. A cry of “! you devil!” and the crash of an empty bottle against the  of his aunt’s woodshed brought him  awake, and a single minute later he was dressed and out of the window and creeping along the  of the “ell” on all fours. He “meow’d”  caution once or twice, as he ;  jumped to the  of the woodshed and thence to the ground. Huckleberry  was there,  his  cat. The  moved off and disappeared in the gloom. At the end of  an    wading through the  grass of the graveyard.
It was a graveyard of the old-fashioned Western . It was on a , about a  and a   the village. It had a crazy board fence around it, which leaned inward in places, and outward the  of the , but stood upright nowhere. Grass and weeds   over the whole cemetery. All the old graves  sunken in, there was not a tombstone on the place; round-topped, -eaten boards staggered over the graves, leaning for support and finding . “Sacred to the memory of” So-and-So had  painted on  once, but it could no longer   , on the  of , now, even if there had  light.
A faint  moaned through the trees, and Tom feared it might be the spirits of the , complaining at being disturbed. The  talked little, and only under their breath, for the  and the place and the pervading solemnity and silence oppressed their spirits.  found the sharp new    seeking, and ensconced themselves within the protection of three great elms   in a bunch within a few  of the grave.
  waited in silence for  seemed a  . The hooting of a distant owl was all the sound  troubled the  stillness. Tom’s reflections  oppressive. He  force  . So he  in a whisper:
“Hucky, do you believe the  people  it for us to be ?”
Huckleberry whispered:
“I wisht I knowed. It’s awful solemn , ain’t it?”
“I bet it is.”
There was a considerable pause, while the  canvassed  matter inwardly.  Tom whispered:
“Say, Hucky—do you reckon  Williams hears us talking?”
“O’ course he . Least his sperrit .”
Tom, after a pause:
“I  I’d  Mister Williams. But I never meant any . Everybody calls him .”
“A  can’t be too partic’lar how   ’bout these-yer  people, Tom.”
 was a damper, and conversation  again.
Presently Tom seized his comrade’s arm and :
“Sh!”
“ is it, Tom?” And the two clung together  beating hearts.
“Sh! There ’tis again! Didn’t you  it?”
“I—”
“There! Now you  it.”
“, Tom, they’re coming! They’re coming, . What’ll we do?”
“I . Think they’ll see us?”
“Oh, Tom,  can see in the ,  as . I wisht I hadn’t .”
“Oh, don’t be afeard. I don’t believe they’ll bother us. We ain’t doing any . If we  perfectly still, maybe  won’t notice us at all.”
“I’ll try to, Tom, but, , I’m all of a shiver.”
“Listen!”
The   their heads together and scarcely breathed. A muffled sound of voices floated up  the far end of the graveyard.
“! See there!” whispered Tom. “ is it?”
“It’s devil-. Oh, Tom,  is awful.”
 vague figures approached through the gloom, swinging an old-fashioned tin lantern  freckled the ground  innumerable little spangles of light. Presently Huckleberry whispered  a shudder:
“It’s the devils  enough. Three of ’em! Lordy, Tom, we’re goners! Can you ?”
“I’ll try, but don’t you be afeard.  ain’t going to  us. ‘Now I lay me  to sleep, I—‘”
“Sh!”
“ is it, ?”
“They’re humans! One of ’em is, anyway. One of ’em’s old  Potter’s voice.”
“No—’tain’t so, is it?”
“I bet I  it. Don’t you  nor budge. He ain’t sharp enough to notice us. Drunk, the  as usual, likely—blamed old rip!”
“All right, I’ll  still. Now they’re stuck. Can’t  it.    again. Now they’re hot.  again. Hot again. Red hot! They’re p’inted right,  . Say, , I  another o’  voices; it’s Injun Joe.”
“That’s so— murderin’ -breed! I’d druther  was devils a  sight.  kin  be up to?”
The whisper  wholly out, now, for the three men had reached the grave and stood within a few  of the boys’ hiding-place.
“ it is,”  the third voice; and the owner of it  the lantern up and revealed the  of young Doctor Robinson.
Potter and Injun Joe  carrying a handbarrow  a  and a couple of shovels on it.    their  and began to open the grave. The doctor put the lantern at the  of the grave and  and sat   his  against one of the elm trees. He was so close the  could  touched him.
“Hurry, men!” he , in a low voice; “the  might  out at any moment.”
 growled a response and  on digging. For   there was no noise but the grating sound of the spades discharging their freight of mould and gravel. It was  monotonous. Finally a spade struck upon the coffin  a  woody accent, and within another minute or two the men had hoisted it out on the ground.  pried off the lid  their shovels, got out the  and dumped it rudely on the ground. The  drifted  behind the clouds and exposed the pallid . The barrow was got ready and the corpse placed on it, covered  a blanket, and bound to its place  the . Potter  out a large spring-knife and cut off the dangling end of the  and  :
“Now the cussed thing’s ready, Sawbones, and you’ll  out  another , or  she stays.”
“That’s the !”  Injun Joe.
“ ,    ?”  the doctor. “You required  pay in advance, and I’ve  you.”
“Yes, and you    ,”  Injun Joe, approaching the doctor, who was now standing. “ years ago you drove me away   father’s kitchen one night,  I  to ask for something to eat, and you  I warn’t there for any ; and  I swore I’d get even  you if it  a hundred years,  father had me jailed for a vagrant. Did you think I’d forget? The Injun blood ain’t in me for nothing. And now I’ve got you, and you got to settle, you !”
He was threatening the doctor,  his  in his , by  . The doctor struck out suddenly and stretched the ruffian on the ground. Potter dropped his knife, and exclaimed:
“, now, don’t you hit my !” and the  moment he had grappled  the doctor and the two  struggling  might and , trampling the grass and tearing the ground  their heels. Injun Joe sprang to his , his eyes flaming  passion, snatched up Potter’s knife, and  creeping, catlike and stooping, round and round about the combatants, seeking an opportunity. All at once the doctor flung himself , seized the heavy headboard of Williams’ grave and felled Potter to the earth  it—and in the  instant the -breed saw his chance and drove the knife to the  in the young man’s breast. He reeled and  partly upon Potter, flooding him  his blood, and in the  moment the clouds blotted out the dreadful spectacle and the two frightened   speeding away in the .
Presently,  the  emerged again, Injun Joe was standing over the two forms, contemplating . The doctor murmured inarticulately,  a   or two and was still. The -breed muttered:
“ score is settled— you.”
 he robbed the . After which he put the fatal knife in Potter’s open right , and sat  on the dismantled coffin. Three—— minutes passed, and  Potter began to  and . His  closed upon the knife; he raised it, glanced at it, and let it ,  a shudder.  he sat up, pushing the   him, and gazed at it, and  around him, confusedly. His eyes met Joe’s.
“, how is , Joe?” he .
“It’s a dirty business,”  Joe, without moving.
“ did you do it for?”
“I! I never  it!”
“ !   of  won’t .”
Potter trembled and  white.
“I thought I’d got sober. I’d no business to drink to-night. But it’s in my  yet—worse’n  we started . I’m all in a muddle; can’t recollect anything of it, hardly.  me, Joe—honest, now, old feller—did I do it? Joe, I never meant to—’pon my  and honor, I never meant to, Joe.  me how it was, Joe. Oh, it’s awful—and him so young and promising.”
“Why, you two was scuffling, and he fetched you one  the headboard and you  ; and  up you , all reeling and staggering , and snatched the knife and jammed it into him,  as he fetched you another awful —and  you’ve , as  as a wedge til now.”
“Oh, I didn’t   I was a-doing. I  I may die  minute if I did. It was all on account of the whiskey and the excitement, I reckon. I never used a weepon in my  before, Joe. I’ve fought, but never  weepons. They’ll all say . Joe, don’t ! Say you won’t , Joe—that’s a  feller. I always liked you, Joe, and stood up for you, too. Don’t you remember? You won’t ,  you, Joe?” And the  creature dropped on his knees before the stolid murderer, and clasped his appealing hands.
“No, you’ve always   and square  me,  Potter, and I won’t go  on you. There, now, that’s as  as a man can say.”
“Oh, Joe, you’re an angel. I’ll bless you for  the longest day I .” And Potter began to cry.
“, now, that’s enough of .  ain’t any  for blubbering. You be off yonder way and I’ll go . , now, and don’t leave any tracks behind you.”
Potter started on a   quickly increased to a run. The -breed stood looking after him. He muttered:
“If  as  stunned  the  and fuddled  the rum as he had the  of being, he won’t think of the knife    so far he’ll be afraid to   after it to  a place by himself—chicken-heart!”
Two or three minutes later the murdered man, the blanketed corpse, the lidless coffin, and the open grave  under no inspection but the moon’s. The stillness was complete again, too.
CHAPTER X
THE two   on and on, toward the village, speechless  horror.  glanced backward over their shoulders   to , apprehensively, as if  feared  might be followed. Every stump  started up in their  seemed a man and an enemy, and   catch their breath; and as   by  outlying cottages  lay  the village, the barking of the aroused watch- seemed to  wings to their .
“If we can only get to the old tannery before we break !” whispered Tom, in short catches between breaths. “I can’t stand it  longer.”
Huckleberry’s  pantings  his only reply, and the  fixed their eyes on the  of their hopes and  to their  to win it.  gained steadily on it, and at , breast to breast,  burst through the open  and  grateful and exhausted in the sheltering shadows beyond. By and by their pulses slowed , and Tom whispered:
“Huckleberry,  do you reckon’ll  of ?”
“If Doctor Robinson , I reckon hanging’ll  of it.”
“Do you though?”
“Why, I  it, Tom.”
Tom thought a while,  he :
“Who’ll ? We?”
“ are you talking about? S’pose something happened and Injun Joe didn’t ? Why,   us   or other,  as   as we’re a laying .”
“That’s   I was thinking to myself, .”
“If anybody tells, let  Potter do it, if   enough.  generally drunk enough.”
Tom  nothing— on thinking. Presently he whispered:
“,  Potter don’t  it. How can he ?”
“What’s the reason he don’t  it?”
“Because   got  whack  Injun Joe  it. D’you reckon he could see anything? D’you reckon he knowed anything?”
“By hokey, that’s so, Tom!”
“And besides, -a-—maybe  whack  for him!”
“No, ’taint likely, Tom. He had liquor in him; I could see ; and besides, he always has. ,  pap’s , you might  and  him over the   a church and you couldn’t phase him. He  so, his own . So it’s the    Potter, of course. But if a man was  sober, I reckon maybe  whack might fetch him; I .”
After another reflective silence, Tom :
“Hucky, you  you can  mum?”
“Tom, we got to  mum. You  .  Injun devil wouldn’t  any  of drownding us  a couple of , if we was to squeak ’bout  and  didn’t  him. Now, -a-, Tom,   and swear to one another—that’s  we got to do—swear to  mum.”
“I’m agreed. It’s the  thing. Would you   hands and swear  we—”
“Oh no,  wouldn’t do for . That’s  enough for little rubbishy common things—specially  , cuz  go  on you anyway, and  if  get in a —but there orter be writing ’bout a big thing  . And blood.”
Tom’s whole being applauded  idea. It was , and , and awful; the , the circumstances, the surroundings,  in keeping  it. He picked up a clean  shingle  lay in the -light,  a little fragment of “red ” out of his pocket, got the  on his , and painfully scrawled these lines, emphasizing each  -stroke by clamping his tongue between his teeth, and letting up the pressure on the up-strokes. [See  .]
“  and Tom Sawyer swears    mum about  and    may    in Their Tracks if  ever  and Rot.”
Huckleberry was filled  admiration of Tom’s facility in writing, and the sublimity of his language. He at once  a pin  his lapel and was going to prick his flesh, but Tom :
“ on! Don’t do . A pin’s brass. It might  verdigrease on it.”
“What’s verdigrease?”
“It’s p’ison. That’s  it is. You  swaller  of it once—you’ll see.”
So Tom unwound the thread  one of his needles, and each boy pricked the  of his thumb and squeezed out a  of blood. In , after  squeezes, Tom managed to  his initials, using the  of his little finger for a pen.  he showed Huckleberry how to  an H and an F, and the oath was complete.  buried the shingle close to the ,   dismal ceremonies and incantations, and the fetters  bound their tongues  considered to be locked and the key thrown away.
A figure crept stealthily through a break in the other end of the ruined building, now, but  did not notice it.
“Tom,” whispered Huckleberry, “   us  ever telling—always?”
“Of course it . It don’t  any difference  happens, we got to  mum.    —don’t you  ?”
“Yes, I reckon that’s so.”
 continued to whisper for  little . Presently a dog set up a , lugubrious   outside—within ten  of . The  clasped each other suddenly, in an agony of fright.
“Which of us  he ?” gasped Huckleberry.
“I — through the crack. Quick!”
“No, you, Tom!”
“I can’t—I can’t do it, !”
“Please, Tom. There ’tis again!”
“Oh, lordy, I’m thankful!” whispered Tom. “I  his voice. It’s  Harbison.” *
[* If Mr. Harbison owned a slave named , Tom would  spoken of him as “Harbison’s ,” but a son or a dog of   was “ Harbison.”]
“Oh, that’s —I  you, Tom, I was  scared to death; I’d a bet anything it was a stray dog.”
The dog howled again. The boys’ hearts  once .
“Oh, my!  ain’t no  Harbison!” whispered Huckleberry. “Do, Tom!”
Tom, quaking  , yielded, and put his eye to the crack. His whisper was hardly audible  he :
“Oh, , its a stray dog!”
“Quick, Tom, quick! Who  he ?”
“, he   us —we’re right together.”
“Oh, Tom, I reckon we’re goners. I reckon there ain’t no mistake ’bout where I’ll go to. I  so wicked.”
“Dad fetch it!  comes of playing hookey and doing everything a feller’s  not to do. I might a  ,  Sid, if I’d a tried—but no, I wouldn’t, of course. But if ever I get off  , I lay I’ll  waller in Sunday-schools!” And Tom began to snuffle a little.
“You bad!” and Huckleberry began to snuffle too. “Consound it, Tom Sawyer, you’re  old pie, ’long- o’  I am. Oh, lordy, lordy, lordy, I wisht I only had   chance.”
Tom choked off and whispered:
“, Hucky, !  got his  to us!”
Hucky looked,  joy in his heart.
“, he has, by jingoes! Did he before?”
“Yes, he did. But I,  a , never thought. Oh,  is bully, you . Now who can he ?”
The howling stopped. Tom pricked up his ears.
“Sh! What’s ?” he whispered.
“Sounds —  grunting. No—it’s somebody snoring, Tom.”
“ is it! Where ’bouts is it, ?”
“I bleeve it’s  at ’tother end. Sounds so, anyway. Pap used to sleep there, sometimes, ’long  the , but  bless you, he  lifts things  he snores. Besides, I reckon he ain’t ever coming  to   any .”
The spirit of adventure  in the boys’ souls once .
“Hucky, do you das’t to go if I ?”
“I don’t  to, . Tom, s’pose it’s Injun Joe!”
Tom quailed. But presently the temptation  up strong again and the  agreed to try,  the understanding   would  to their heels if the snoring stopped. So   tiptoeing stealthily , the one behind the other.   had got to within  steps of the snorer, Tom stepped on a stick, and it broke  a sharp . The man moaned, writhed a little, and his   into the moonlight. It was  Potter. The boys’ hearts had stood still, and their hopes too,  the man moved, but their fears passed away now.  tip- out, through the broken weather-boarding, and stopped at a little distance to exchange a parting .  , lugubrious   on the night air again!  turned and saw the strange dog standing within a few  of where Potter was lying, and facing Potter,  his  pointing heavenward.
“Oh, geeminy, it’s him!” exclaimed  , in a breath.
“Say, Tom— say a stray dog  howling around Johnny Miller’s house, ’bout midnight, as  as two weeks ago; and a whippoorwill  in and lit on the banisters and , the   evening; and there ain’t anybody  there yet.”
“, I  . And suppose there ain’t. Didn’t Gracie Miller  in the kitchen  and  herself terrible the   Saturday?”
“Yes, but she ain’t . And what’s , she’s getting better, too.”
“All right, you  and see. She’s a goner,  as   as  Potter’s a goner. That’s  the niggers say, and   all about these  of things, .”
  separated, cogitating.  Tom crept in at his bedroom window the night was almost spent. He undressed  excessive caution, and  asleep congratulating himself  nobody  of his escapade. He was not aware  the gently-snoring Sid was awake, and had  so for an .
 Tom awoke, Sid was dressed and . There was a   in the light, a  sense in the atmosphere. He was startled. Why had he not  called—persecuted  he was up, as usual? The thought filled him  bodings. Within  minutes he was dressed and -stairs, feeling  and drowsy. The family  still at table, but  had finished breakfast. There was no voice of rebuke; but there  averted eyes; there was a silence and an air of solemnity  struck a chill to the culprit’s heart. He sat  and tried to  gay, but it was up- ; it roused no smile, no response, and he lapsed into silence and let his heart   to the depths.
After breakfast his aunt  him aside, and Tom almost brightened in the   he was going to be flogged; but it was not so. His aunt  over him and asked him how he could go and break her old heart so; and finally  him to go on, and  himself and bring her  hairs  sorrow to the grave, for it was no use for her to try any .  was worse  a thousand whippings, and Tom’s heart was sorer now  his . He cried, he pleaded for forgiveness, promised to reform over and over again, and  received his dismissal, feeling  he had won but an imperfect forgiveness and established but a feeble confidence.

CHAPTER XI
CLOSE upon the  of  the whole village was suddenly electrified  the ghastly . No  of the as yet un-dreamed-of telegraph; the    man to man,  group to group,  house to house,  little   telegraphic speed. Of course the schoolmaster  -day for  afternoon; the  would  thought strangely of him if he had not.
A  knife had  found close to the murdered man, and it had  recognized by somebody as belonging to  Potter—so the story ran. And it was   a belated citizen had  upon Potter washing himself in the “branch” about one or two o’clock in the morning, and  Potter had at once sneaked off—suspicious circumstances, especially the washing which was not a habit  Potter. It was also   the  had  ransacked for  “murderer” (the public are not  in the matter of sifting evidence and arriving at a verdict), but  he could not be found. Horsemen had departed  all the roads in every direction, and the Sheriff “was confident”  he would be captured before night.
All the  was drifting toward the graveyard. Tom’s heartbreak vanished and he joined the procession, not because he would not a thousand times rather go anywhere else, but because an awful, unaccountable fascination  him on. Arrived at the dreadful place, he wormed his small  through the crowd and saw the dismal spectacle. It seemed to him an age since he was there before. Somebody pinched his arm. He turned, and his eyes met Huckleberry’s.   looked elsewhere at once, and wondered if anybody had noticed anything in their mutual glance. But everybody was talking, and intent upon the grisly spectacle before .
“ fellow!” “ young fellow!” “ ought to be a lesson to grave robbers!” “ Potter’ll  for  if  catch him!”  was the drift of remark; and the minister , “It was a judgment; His  is .”
Now Tom shivered   to ; for his eye  upon the stolid  of Injun Joe. At  moment the crowd began to  and struggle, and voices shouted, “It’s him! it’s him!  coming himself!”
“Who? Who?”  twenty voices.
“ Potter!”
“Hallo,  stopped!— out,  turning! Don’t let him get away!”
People in the branches of the trees over Tom’s   he wasn’t trying to get away—he only looked doubtful and perplexed.
“Infernal impudence!”  a bystander; “wanted to  and  a quiet  at his , I reckon—didn’t expect any company.”
The crowd  apart, now, and the Sheriff  through, ostentatiously leading Potter by the arm. The  fellow’s  was haggard, and his eyes showed the   was upon him.  he stood before the murdered man, he shook as  a palsy, and he put his  in his hands and burst into tears.
“I didn’t do it, friends,” he sobbed; “’pon my  and honor I never  it.”
“Who’s accused you?” shouted a voice.
  seemed to carry . Potter lifted his  and looked around him  a pathetic hopelessness in his eyes. He saw Injun Joe, and exclaimed:
“Oh, Injun Joe, you promised me you’d never—”
“Is   knife?” and it was thrust before him by the Sheriff.
Potter would  fallen if  had not caught him and eased him to the ground.  he :
“Something  me ’t if I didn’t   and get—” He shuddered;  waved his nerveless   a vanquished gesture and , “ ’em, Joe,  ’em—it ain’t any use any .”
 Huckleberry and Tom stood  and staring, and heard the stony-hearted   off his serene statement,  expecting every moment  the clear sky would deliver God’s lightnings upon his , and wondering to see how  the stroke was delayed. And  he had finished and still stood alive and whole, their wavering impulse to break their oath and  the  betrayed prisoner’s  faded and vanished away, for plainly  miscreant had  himself to Satan and it would be fatal to meddle  the property of  a power as .

“I couldn’t  it—I couldn’t  it,” Potter moaned. “I wanted to run away, but I couldn’t  to  anywhere but .” And he  to sobbing again.
Injun Joe repeated his statement,  as calmly, a few minutes afterward on the inquest, under oath; and the , seeing  the lightnings  still withheld,  confirmed in their belief  Joe had  himself to the devil. He was now become, to , the  balefully interesting object  had ever looked upon, and  could not  their fascinated eyes  his .
 inwardly resolved to watch him nights,  opportunity should offer, in the  of getting a glimpse of his dread master.
Injun Joe helped to raise the  of the murdered man and put it in a wagon for removal; and it was whispered through the shuddering crowd  the wound  a little! The  thought   happy circumstance would  suspicion in the right direction; but   disappointed, for   one villager remarked:
“It was within three  of  Potter  it  it.”
Tom’s fearful secret and gnawing conscience disturbed his sleep for as  as a  after ; and at breakfast one morning Sid :
“Tom, you pitch around and  in  sleep so   you  me awake  the .”
Tom blanched and dropped his eyes.
“It’s a bad ,”  Aunt Polly, gravely. “ you got on  , Tom?”
“Nothing. Nothing ’t I  of.” But the boy’s  shook so  he spilled his coffee.
“And you do   stuff,” Sid . “ night you , ‘It’s blood, it’s blood, that’s  it is!’ You   over and over. And you , ‘Don’t torment me so—I’ll !’  ?  is it you’ll ?”
Everything was swimming before Tom. There is no telling  might  happened, now, but luckily the concern passed out of Aunt Polly’s  and she  to Tom’s relief without knowing it. She :
“Sho! It’s  dreadful murder. I dream about it  every night myself. Sometimes I dream it’s me   it.”
  she had  affected  the  way. Sid seemed satisfied. Tom got out of the presence as quick as he plausibly could, and after  he complained of toothache for a , and  up his  every night. He never   Sid lay nightly watching, and frequently slipped the bandage  and  leaned on his elbow listening a  while at a , and afterward slipped the bandage  to its place again. Tom’s distress of   off gradually and the toothache  irksome and was discarded. If Sid really managed to  anything out of Tom’s disjointed mutterings, he  it to himself.
It seemed to Tom  his schoolmates never would get  holding inquests on  , and  keeping his trouble present to his . Sid noticed  Tom never was coroner at one of these inquiries, though it had  his habit to  the  in all new enterprises; he noticed, too,  Tom never acted as a witness—and  was strange; and Sid did not overlook the   Tom even showed a marked aversion to these inquests, and always avoided   he could. Sid marvelled, but  nothing. However, even inquests  out of vogue at , and ceased to torture Tom’s conscience.
Every day or two, during   of sorrow, Tom watched his opportunity and  to the little grated -window and smuggled  small comforts through to the “murderer” as he could get  of. The  was a trifling little brick den  stood in a marsh at the edge of the village, and no guards  afforded for it; indeed, it was seldom occupied. These offerings greatly helped to ease Tom’s conscience.
The villagers had a strong desire to tar-and-feather Injun Joe and  him on a , for -snatching, but so formidable was his character  nobody could be found who was willing to  the  in the matter, so it was dropped. He had  careful to begin  of his inquest-statements  the fight, without confessing the grave-robbery  preceded it; therefore it was deemed wisest not to try the  in the courts at present.
CHAPTER XII
ONE of the reasons why Tom’s  had drifted away  its secret troubles was,  it had found a new and weighty matter to interest itself about. Becky Thatcher had stopped coming to school. Tom had struggled  his pride a few , and tried to “whistle her  the ,” but failed. He began to  himself hanging around her father’s house, nights, and feeling  miserable. She was ill.  if she should die! There was distraction in the thought. He no longer  an interest in war, nor even in piracy. The charm of  was ; there was nothing but dreariness . He put his  away, and his bat; there was no joy in  any . His aunt was concerned. She began to try all manner of remedies on him. She was one of those people who are infatuated  patent medicines and all new-fangled methods of producing health or mending it. She was an inveterate experimenter in these things.  something fresh in    out she was in a fever, right away, to try it; not on herself, for she was never ailing, but on anybody else   handy. She was a subscriber for all the “Health” periodicals and phrenological frauds; and the solemn ignorance   inflated  was breath to her nostrils. All the “rot”  contained about ventilation, and how to go to bed, and how to get up, and  to eat, and  to drink, and how  exercise to , and  frame of  to  one’s  in, and   of clothing to , was all gospel to her, and she never observed  her health-journals of the current month customarily upset everything  had recommended the month before. She was as simple-hearted and honest as the day was , and so she was an easy victim. She gathered together her quack periodicals and her quack medicines, and  armed  death,  about on her  horse, metaphorically speaking,  “ following after.” But she never suspected  she was not an angel of healing and the  of Gilead in disguise, to the suffering neighbors.
The water treatment was new, now, and Tom’s low condition was a windfall to her. She had him out at daylight every morning, stood him up in the - and drowned him  a deluge of  water;  she scrubbed him   a towel  a , and so brought him to;  she rolled him up in a wet sheet and put him away under blankets  she sweated his  clean and “the yellow stains of it  through his pores”—as Tom .
Yet notwithstanding all , the boy   and  melancholy and  and dejected. She added hot baths,  baths, shower baths, and plunges. The boy remained as dismal as a hearse. She began to assist the water  a  oatmeal  and blister-plasters. She calculated his capacity as she would a jug’s, and filled him up every day  quack -alls.
Tom had become indifferent to persecution by  .  phase filled the old lady’s heart  consternation.  indifference  be broken up at any . Now she heard of -killer for the first . She ordered a lot at once. She tasted it and was filled  gratitude. It was simply  in a liquid . She dropped the water treatment and everything else, and pinned her faith to -killer. She  Tom a teaspoonful and watched  the deepest anxiety for the result. Her troubles  instantly at , her  at peace again; for the “indifference” was broken up. The boy could not  shown a wilder, heartier interest, if she had built a  under him.
Tom   it was  to  up;   of  might be romantic enough, in his blighted condition, but it was getting to  too little sentiment and too  distracting variety about it. So he thought over various plans for relief, and finally hit upon  of professing to be  of -killer. He asked for it so often  he became a nuisance, and his aunt ended by telling him to  himself and  bothering her. If it had  Sid, she would  had no misgivings to alloy her delight; but since it was Tom, she watched the bottle clandestinely. She found  the medicine did really diminish, but it did not occur to her  the boy was mending the health of a crack in the sitting- floor  it.
One day Tom was in the act of dosing the crack  his aunt’s yellow cat  along, purring, eyeing the teaspoon avariciously, and begging for a taste. Tom :
“Don’t ask for it unless you  it, Peter.”
But Peter signified  he did  it.
“You better  .”
Peter was .
“Now you’ve asked for it, and I’ll  it to you, because there ain’t anything  about me; but if you  you don’t  it, you mustn’t blame anybody but  own .”
Peter was agreeable. So Tom pried his mouth open and poured  the -killer. Peter sprang a couple of yards in the air, and  delivered a war-whoop and set off round and round the , banging against furniture, upsetting flower-, and making general havoc.  he  on his   and pranced around, in a frenzy of enjoyment,  his  over his shoulder and his voice proclaiming his unappeasable happiness.  he  tearing around the house again spreading chaos and destruction in his . Aunt Polly entered in  to see him throw a few double summersets, deliver a final mighty hurrah, and  through the open window, carrying the  of the flower-  him. The old  stood petrified  astonishment, peering over her glasses; Tom lay on the floor expiring  laughter.
“Tom,  on earth ails  cat?”
“I don’t , aunt,” gasped the boy.
“Why, I never see anything  it.  did  him act so?”
“ I don’t , Aunt Polly;  always act so  they’re having a  .”
“ do, do ?” There was something in the    Tom apprehensive.
“Yes’m.  is, I believe  do.”
“You do?”
“Yes’m.”
The old  was bending , Tom watching,  interest emphasized by anxiety. Too  he divined her “drift.” The handle of the telltale tea-spoon was visible under the bed-valance. Aunt Polly  it,  it up. Tom winced, and dropped his eyes. Aunt Polly raised him by the usual handle—his ear—and cracked his  soundly  her thimble.
“Now, sir,  did you  to treat    beast so, for?”
“I  it out of  for him—because he hadn’t any aunt.”
“Hadn’t any aunt!—you numskull.  has  got to do  it?”
“Heaps. Because if  had one she’d a burnt him out herself! She’d a roasted his bowels out of him ’thout any  feeling  if he was a human!”
Aunt Polly  a sudden  of remorse.  was putting the thing in a new light;  was cruelty to a cat might be cruelty to a boy, too. She began to soften; she  sorry. Her eyes watered a little, and she put her  on Tom’s  and  gently:
“I was meaning for the , Tom. And, Tom, it did do you .”
Tom looked up in her    a perceptible twinkle peeping through his gravity.
“I  you was meaning for the , aunty, and so was I  Peter. It  him , too. I never see him get around so since—”
“Oh, go ’long  you, Tom, before you aggravate me again. And you try and see if you can’t be a  boy, for once, and you needn’t  any  medicine.”
Tom reached school ahead of . It was noticed   strange thing had  occurring every day latterly. And now, as usual of , he  about the  of the schoolyard instead of playing  his comrades. He was , he , and he looked it. He tried to  to be looking everywhere but whither he really was looking— the . Presently  Thatcher  in sight, and Tom’s  lighted; he gazed a moment, and  turned sorrowfully away.   arrived, Tom accosted him; and “led up” warily to opportunities for remark about Becky, but the giddy lad never could see the . Tom watched and watched, hoping whenever a frisking frock  in sight, and hating the owner of it as  as he saw she was not the right one. At  frocks ceased to appear, and he dropped hopelessly into the dumps; he entered the empty schoolhouse and sat  to suffer.  one  frock passed in at the , and Tom’s heart  a great bound. The  instant he was out, and “going on”  an Indian; yelling, laughing, chasing , jumping over the fence at  of  and , throwing handsprings, standing on his —doing all the heroic things he could conceive of, and keeping a furtive eye out, all the while, to see if Becky Thatcher was noticing. But she seemed to be unconscious of it all; she never looked. Could it be possible  she was not aware  he was there? He carried his exploits to her immediate vicinity;  war-whooping around, snatched a boy’s cap, hurled it to the  of the schoolhouse, broke through a group of , tumbling  in every direction, and  sprawling, himself, under Becky’s , almost upsetting her—and she turned,  her  in the air, and he heard her say: “Mf!  people think they’re mighty smart—always showing off!”
Tom’s cheeks burned. He gathered himself up and sneaked off, crushed and crestfallen.
CHAPTER 
TOM’S  was  up now. He was gloomy and desperate. He was a forsaken, friendless boy, he ; nobody loved him;   found out   had driven him to, perhaps  would be sorry; he had tried to do right and get along, but  would not let him; since nothing would do  but to be rid of him, let it be so; and let  blame him for the consequences—why shouldn’t ?  right had the friendless to complain? Yes,  had forced him to it at : he would  a  of crime. There was no choice.
By   he was far  Meadow , and the  for school to “ up” tinkled faintly upon his ear. He sobbed, now, to think he should never, never   old familiar sound any —it was  , but it was forced on him; since he was driven out into the  world, he  submit—but he forgave .  the   thick and .
 at  point he met his soul’s sworn comrade, Joe Harper—-eyed, and  evidently a great and dismal purpose in his heart. Plainly   “two souls  but a single thought.” Tom, wiping his eyes  his sleeve, began to blubber out something about a resolution to escape   usage and  of sympathy at  by roaming abroad into the great world never to return; and ended by hoping  Joe would not forget him.
But it transpired   was a request which Joe had   going to  of Tom, and had  to  him up for  purpose. His mother had whipped him for drinking  cream which he had never tasted and  nothing about; it was plain  she was tired of him and wished him to go; if she   way, there was nothing for him to do but succumb; he hoped she would be happy, and never regret having driven her  boy out into the unfeeling world to suffer and die.
As the two  walked sorrowing along,   a new compact to stand by each other and be brothers and never separate  death relieved  of their troubles.   began to lay their plans. Joe was for being a hermit, and living on crusts in a remote , and dying,  , of  and  and grief; but after listening to Tom, he conceded  there   conspicuous advantages about a  of crime, and so he consented to be a pirate.
Three miles below St. Petersburg, at a point where the Mississippi River was a trifle over a  , there was a , narrow, wooded island,  a shallow bar at the  of it, and  offered  as a rendezvous. It was not inhabited; it lay far over toward the further shore, abreast a dense and almost wholly unpeopled forest. So Jackson’s Island was chosen. Who  to be the subjects of their piracies was a matter  did not occur to .   hunted up Huckleberry , and he joined  promptly, for all careers  one to him; he was indifferent.  presently separated to  at a lonely  on the river- two miles above the village at the favorite —which was midnight. There was a small log  there which  meant to capture. Each would bring hooks and lines, and  provision as he could steal in the   and mysterious way—as became outlaws. And before the afternoon was ,  had all managed to enjoy the sweet glory of spreading the   pretty  the  would “ something.” All who got  vague   cautioned to “be mum and .”
About midnight Tom arrived  a boiled ham and a few trifles, and stopped in a dense undergrowth on a small bluff overlooking the meeting-place. It was starlight, and  still. The mighty river lay  an ocean at . Tom listened a moment, but no sound disturbed the quiet.  he  a low, distinct whistle. It was answered  under the bluff. Tom whistled twice ; these signals  answered in the  way.  a guarded voice :
“Who  there?”
“Tom Sawyer, the Black Avenger of the Spanish .   names.”
“  the Red-Handed, and Joe Harper the Terror of the .” Tom had furnished these titles,  his favorite literature.
“’Tis .  the countersign.”
Two hoarse whispers delivered the  awful  simultaneously to the brooding night:
“Blood!”
 Tom tumbled his ham over the bluff and let himself  after it, tearing   and clothes to  extent in the effort. There was an easy, comfortable  along the shore under the bluff, but it lacked the advantages of difficulty and danger so valued by a pirate.
The Terror of the  had brought a  of bacon, and had about  himself out  getting it there.  the Red-Handed had stolen a skillet and a quantity of -cured  tobacco, and had also brought a few - to  pipes . But  of the pirates smoked or “chewed” but himself. The Black Avenger of the Spanish   it would never do to start without  .  was a  thought; matches  hardly known there in  day.  saw a  smouldering upon a great  a hundred yards above, and   stealthily thither and helped themselves to a chunk.   an imposing adventure of it, saying, “!” every now and , and suddenly halting  finger on lip; moving  hands on imaginary dagger-hilts; and giving orders in dismal whispers  if “the foe” stirred, to “let him  it to the ,” because “ men  no tales.”    enough  the raftsmen  all  at the village laying in stores or having a spree, but still  was no excuse for their conducting  thing in an unpiratical way.
 shoved off, presently, Tom in command,  at the after oar and Joe at the forward. Tom stood amidships, gloomy-browed, and  folded arms, and  his orders in a low, stern whisper:
“, and bring her to the !”
“Aye-aye, sir!”
“Steady, steady-y-y-y!”
“Steady it is, sir!”
“Let her go off a point!”
“Point it is, sir!”
As the  steadily and monotonously drove the  toward mid-stream it was no doubt understood  these orders  given only for “style,” and  not intended to  anything in particular.
“ sail’s she carrying?”
“Courses, tops’ls, and flying-jib, sir.”

“Aye-aye, sir!”
“Shake out  maintogalans’l! Sheets and braces! now my hearties!”

Hardly a  was  during the  three-quarters of an . Now the  was passing before the distant . Two or three glimmering lights showed where it lay, peacefully sleeping, beyond the vague  sweep of -gemmed water, unconscious of the tremendous event  was happening.

It was but a small strain on his imagination to remove Jackson’s Island beyond eye- of the village, and so he “looked his ”  a broken and satisfied heart. The other pirates  looking their , too; and  all looked so      letting the current drift  out of the range of the island. But  discovered the danger in , and  shift to avert it. About two o’clock in the morning the  grounded on the bar two hundred yards above the  of the island, and  waded  and forth until  had landed their freight.  of the little raft’s belongings consisted of an old , and   spread over a  in the bushes for a  to shelter their provisions; but  themselves would sleep in the open air in  weather, as became outlaws.

It seemed glorious sport to be feasting in  ,  way in the virgin forest of an unexplored and uninhabited island, far  the haunts of men, and    never would return to civilization. The climbing  lit up their faces and threw its ruddy glare upon the pillared -trunks of their forest temple, and upon the varnished foliage and festooning vines.

“Ain’t it gay?”  Joe.
“It’s !”  Tom. “ would the  say if  could see us?”
“Say? , they’d  die to be —hey, Hucky!”
“I reckon so,”  Huckleberry; “anyways, I’m suited. I don’t  nothing better’n . I don’t ever get enough to eat, gen’ally—and   can’t  and  at a feller and bullyrag him so.”
“It’s  the  for me,”  Tom. “You don’t  to get up, mornings, and you don’t  to go to school, and , and all  blame foolishness. You see a pirate don’t  to do anything, Joe,   ashore, but a hermit he has to be praying considerable, and  he don’t  any fun, anyway, all by himself  way.”
“Oh yes, that’s so,”  Joe, “but I hadn’t thought  about it, you . I’d a   rather be a pirate, now  I’ve tried it.”
“You see,”  Tom, “people don’t go  on hermits, nowadays,   used to in old times, but a pirate’s always respected. And a hermit’s got to sleep on the hardest place he can , and put sackcloth and ashes on his , and stand out in the , and—”
“  he put sackcloth and ashes on his  for?” inquired .

“Why, , you’d  to. How’d you get around it?”
“Why, I  wouldn’t stand it. I’d run away.”
“Run away! , you would be a  old slouch of a hermit. You’d be a disgrace.”
The Red-Handed  no response, being better employed. He had finished gouging out a cob, and now he fitted a   to it, loaded it  tobacco, and was pressing a  to the charge and blowing a cloud of fragrant smoke—he was in the  bloom of luxurious contentment. The other pirates envied him  majestic , and secretly resolved to acquire it shortly. Presently  :
“  pirates  to do?”
Tom :
“Oh,    a bully — ships and  , and get the money and  it in awful places in their island where there’s ghosts and things to watch it, and  everybody in the ships— ’em  a plank.”
“And  carry the women to the island,”  Joe; “ don’t  the women.”
“No,” assented Tom, “ don’t  the women—they’re too noble. And the women’s always beautiful, too.
“And don’t   the bulliest clothes! Oh no! All  and silver and di’monds,”  Joe,  enthusiasm.
“Who?”  .
“Why, the pirates.”

“I reckon I ain’t dressed fitten for a pirate,”  he,  a regretful pathos in his voice; “but I ain’t got  but these.”

The Terror of the  and the Black Avenger of the Spanish  had  difficulty in getting to sleep.   their prayers inwardly, and lying , since there was nobody there  authority to   kneel and recite aloud; in truth,  had a  not to say  at all, but   afraid to proceed to  lengths as ,   might   a sudden and special thunderbolt  heaven.  at once  reached and hovered upon the imminent verge of sleep—but an intruder , now,  would not “.” It was conscience.  began to  a vague    had  doing wrong to run away; and   thought of the stolen , and  the  torture .  tried to argue it away by reminding conscience   had purloined sweetmeats and apples scores of times; but conscience was not to be appeased by   plausibilities; it seemed to , in the end,  there was no getting around the stubborn   taking sweetmeats was only “hooking,” while taking bacon and  and  valuables was plain simple stealing—and there was a command against  in the Bible. So  inwardly resolved  so  as  remained in the business, their piracies should not again be sullied  the crime of stealing.  conscience granted a truce, and these curiously inconsistent pirates  peacefully to sleep.
CHAPTER XIV
 Tom awoke in the morning, he wondered where he was. He sat up and rubbed his eyes and looked around.  he comprehended. It was the   , and there was a delicious sense of repose and peace in the  pervading  and silence of the woods. Not a  stirred; not a sound obtruded upon great Nature’s meditation. Beaded dewdrops stood upon the leaves and grasses. A white layer of ashes covered the , and a   breath of smoke  straight into the air. Joe and  still slept.
Now, far away in the woods a  called; another answered; presently the hammering of a woodpecker was heard. Gradually the  dim  of the morning whitened, and as gradually sounds multiplied and  manifested itself. The marvel of Nature shaking off sleep and going to  unfolded itself to the musing boy. A little green   crawling over a  , lifting two-thirds of his  into the air   to  and “sniffing around,”  proceeding again—for he was measuring, Tom ; and  the  approached him, of its own accord, he sat as still as a stone,  his hopes rising and falling, by turns, as the creature still  toward him or seemed inclined to go elsewhere; and  at  it considered a painful moment  its curved  in the air and   decisively  upon Tom’s leg and began a journey over him, his whole heart was —for  meant  he was going to  a new  of clothes—without the shadow of a doubt a gaudy piratical uniform. Now a procession of ants appeared,  nowhere in particular, and  about their labors; one struggled manfully by  a  spider  times as big as itself in its arms, and lugged it straight up a -trunk. A brown spotted -bug climbed the dizzy height of a grass blade, and Tom   close to it and , “-bug, -bug, fly away ,  house is on ,  children’s alone,” and she   and  off to see about it—which did not surprise the boy, for he  of old   insect was credulous about conflagrations, and he had practised upon its simplicity   once. A tumblebug  , heaving sturdily at its , and Tom touched the creature, to see it  its  against its  and pretend to be . The birds  fairly rioting by  . A catbird, the Northern mocker, lit in a  over Tom’s , and trilled out her imitations of her neighbors in a rapture of enjoyment;  a shrill jay swept , a flash of  flame, and stopped on a  almost within the boy’s reach, cocked his  to one  and eyed the strangers  a consuming curiosity; a  squirrel and a big fellow of the “fox”   skurrying along, sitting up at intervals to inspect and chatter at the , for the  things had probably never  a human being before and scarcely  whether to be afraid or not. All Nature was  awake and stirring, now;  lances of sunlight pierced  through the dense foliage far and , and a few butterflies  fluttering upon the scene.
Tom stirred up the other pirates and  all clattered away  a shout, and in a minute or two  stripped and chasing after and tumbling over each other in the shallow limpid water of the white sandbar.   no longing for the little village sleeping in the distance beyond the majestic waste of water.

While Joe was slicing bacon for breakfast, Tom and  asked him to  on a minute;  stepped to a promising  in the river- and threw in their lines; almost immediately  had reward.

There was a  silence, profound and unbroken;  a , sullen   floating  out of the distance.

“I wonder,”  Tom in a whisper.

Presently a great jet of white smoke burst  the ferryboat’s , and as it expanded and  in a  cloud,    throb of sound was borne to the listeners again.
“I  now!” exclaimed Tom; “somebody’s drownded!”
“That’s it!”  ; “    summer,   Turner got drownded;  shoot a cannon over the water, and  makes him  up to the top. Yes, and   loaves of bread and put quicksilver in ’em and set ’em afloat, and wherever there’s anybody that’s drownded, they’ll float right there and .”

CHAPTER XV
A few minutes later Tom was in the shoal water of the bar, wading toward the Illinois shore. Before the depth reached his middle he was halfway over; the current would permit no  wading, now, so he struck out confidently to  the remaining hundred yards. He  quartering upstream, but still was swept downward rather faster  he had expected. However, he reached the shore finally, and drifted along  he found a low place and  himself out. He put his  on his jacket pocket, found his piece of  , and  struck through the woods, following the shore,  streaming garments. Shortly before ten o’clock he  out into an open place opposite the village, and saw the ferryboat lying in the shadow of the trees and the  . Everything was quiet under the blinking stars. He crept  the , watching  all his eyes, slipped into the water,  three or  strokes and climbed into the skiff  did “”  at the boat’s stern. He  himself  under the thwarts and waited, panting.
Presently the cracked  tapped and a voice  the order to “ off.” A minute or two later the skiff’s  was standing  up, against the boat’s swell, and the voyage was begun. Tom  happy in his success, for he  it was the boat’s   for the night. At the end of a  twelve or fifteen minutes the wheels stopped, and Tom slipped overboard and  ashore in the , landing fifty yards downstream, out of danger of possible stragglers.
He  along unfrequented alleys, and shortly found himself at his aunt’s  fence. He climbed over, approached the “ell,” and looked in at the sitting- window, for a light was burning there. There sat Aunt Polly, Sid, , and Joe Harper’s mother, grouped together, talking.   by the bed, and the bed was between  and the . Tom  to the  and began to softly  the latch;  he pressed gently and the  yielded a crack; he continued pushing cautiously, and quaking every  it creaked,  he judged he might squeeze through on his knees; so he put his  through and began, warily.
“ makes the candle  so?”  Aunt Polly. Tom hurried up. “Why,  door’s open, I believe. Why, of course it is. No end of strange things now. Go ’long and  it, Sid.”
Tom disappeared under the bed  in . He lay and “breathed” himself for a , and  crept to where he could almost touch his aunt’s .
“But as I was saying,”  Aunt Polly, “he warn’t bad, so to say—only mischeevous. Only  giddy, and harum-scarum, you . He warn’t any  responsible  a . He never meant any , and he was the -hearted boy  ever was”—and she began to cry.
“It was  so  my Joe—always  of his devilment, and up to every  of mischief, but he was  as unselfish and  as he could be—and  bless me, to think I  and whipped him for taking  cream, never once recollecting  I throwed it out myself because it was , and I never to see him again in  world, never, never, never,  abused boy!” And Mrs. Harper sobbed as if her heart would break.
“I  Tom’s better off where he is,”  Sid, “but if   better in  —”
“Sid!” Tom  the glare of the old lady’s eye, though he could not see it. “Not a  against my Tom, now   ! God’ll   of him—never you trouble yourself, sir! Oh, Mrs. Harper, I don’t  how to  him up! I don’t  how to  him up! He was  a comfort to me, although he tormented my old heart out of me, ’most.”
“The  giveth and the   taken away—Blessed be the  of the ! But it’s so —Oh, it’s so ! Only  Saturday my Joe busted a firecracker right under my  and I knocked him sprawling. Little did I  , how —Oh, if it was to do over again I’d hug him and bless him for it.”
“Yes, yes, yes, I   how you , Mrs. Harper, I   exactly how you . No longer ago  yesterday , my Tom  and filled the cat  of -killer, and I did think the cretur would  the house . And God forgive me, I cracked Tom’s   my thimble,  boy,   boy. But  out of all his troubles now. And the  words I ever heard him say was to reproach—”
But  memory was too  for the old , and she broke entirely . Tom was snuffling, now, himself—and  in  of himself  anybody else. He could   crying, and putting in a kindly  for him   to . He began to  a nobler opinion of himself  ever before. Still, he was sufficiently touched by his aunt’s grief to  to  out  under the bed and overwhelm her  joy—and the theatrical gorgeousness of the thing appealed strongly to his nature, too, but he resisted and lay still.
He  on listening, and gathered by odds and ends  it was conjectured at first  the  had got drowned while taking a ;  the small  had  missed; , certain   the missing  had promised  the village should “ something” ; the -heads had “put  and  together” and decided  the  had  off on   and would  up at the   below, presently; but toward  the  had  found, lodged against the Missouri shore   or six miles below the village—and   perished;   be drowned, else hunger would  driven   by nightfall if not sooner.

If the bodies continued missing until Sunday, all  would be given over, and the funerals would be preached on  morning. Tom shuddered.
Mrs. Harper  a sobbing goodnight and turned to go.   a mutual impulse the two bereaved women flung themselves into each other’s arms and had a , consoling cry, and  parted. Aunt Polly was tender far beyond her , in her goodnight to Sid and . Sid snuffled a bit and   off crying  all her heart.
Aunt Polly knelt  and prayed for Tom so touchingly, so appealingly, and   measureless  in her words and her old trembling voice,  he was weltering in tears again,  before she was through.
He had to  still  after she  to bed, for she  making broken-hearted ejaculations   to , tossing unrestfully, and turning over. But at  she was still, only moaning a little in her sleep. Now the boy stole out,  gradually by the bedside, shaded the candle-light  his , and stood regarding her. His heart was  of  for her. He  out his sycamore scroll and placed it by the candle. But something occurred to him, and he lingered considering. His  lighted  a happy solution of his thought; he put the  hastily in his pocket.  he  over and kissed the faded , and straightway  his stealthy exit, latching the  behind him.
He threaded his way  to the ferry landing, found nobody at large there, and walked boldly on board the , for he  she was tenantless except  there was a watchman, who always turned in and slept  a graven image. He untied the skiff at the stern, slipped into it, and was  rowing cautiously upstream.  he had pulled a  above the village, he started quartering across and  himself stoutly to his . He hit the landing on the other  neatly, for  was a familiar bit of  to him. He was moved to capture the skiff, arguing  it might be considered a  and therefore legitimate  for a pirate, but he  a thorough search would be  for it and  might end in revelations. So he stepped ashore and entered the woods.
He sat  and  a  , torturing himself meanwhile to  awake, and  started warily  the -stretch. The night was far spent. It was broad daylight before he found himself fairly abreast the island bar. He rested again until the sun was  up and gilding the great river  its splendor, and  he plunged into the stream. A little later he paused, dripping, upon the threshold of the , and heard Joe say:
“No, Tom’s -, , and he’ll  . He won’t desert. He knows  would be a disgrace to a pirate, and Tom’s too proud for   of thing.  up to something or other. Now I wonder ?”

“Pretty , but not yet, . The writing   are if he ain’t   to breakfast.”
“Which he is!” exclaimed Tom,   dramatic effect, stepping grandly into .
A sumptuous breakfast of bacon and  was shortly provided, and as the  set to  upon it, Tom recounted (and adorned) his adventures.   a  and boastful company of heroes  the  was .  Tom hid himself away in a shady  to sleep  , and the other pirates got ready to  and explore.

He erased it once  and   himself out of temptation by driving the other  together and joining .
But Joe’s spirits had   almost beyond resurrection. He was so homesick  he could hardly endure the misery of it. The tears lay   the surface.  was melancholy, too. Tom was downhearted, but tried  not to  it. He had a secret which he was not ready to , yet, but if  mutinous depression was not broken up , he would  to bring it out. He ,  a great  of cheerfulness:
“I bet there’s  pirates on  island before, . We’ll explore it again. They’ve hid treasures  somewhere. How’d you  to light on a rotten chest  of  and silver—hey?”
But it roused only faint enthusiasm, which faded out,  no reply. Tom tried one or two other seductions; but  failed, too. It was discouraging . Joe sat poking up the   a stick and looking  gloomy. Finally he :
“Oh, , let’s  it up. I  to go . It’s so lonesome.”
“Oh no, Joe, you’ll  better by and by,”  Tom. “ think of the fishing that’s .”
“I don’t  for fishing. I  to go .”
“But, Joe, there ain’t  another swimming-place anywhere.”
“Swimming’s no . I don’t  to  for it, somehow,  there ain’t anybody to say I sha’n’t go in. I  to go .”
“Oh, shucks! ! You  to see  mother, I reckon.”
“Yes, I do  to see my mother—and you would, too, if you had one. I ain’t any    you are.” And Joe snuffled a little.

 , “Y-e-s”—without any heart in it.
“I’ll never speak to you again as  as I ,”  Joe, rising. “There now!” And he moved moodily away and began to dress himself.
“Who cares!”  Tom. “Nobody wants you to. Go ’long  and get laughed at. Oh, you’re a  pirate.  and me ain’t crybabies. We’ll , won’t we, ? Let him go if he wants to. I reckon we can get along without him, per’aps.”
But Tom was uneasy, nevertheless, and was alarmed to see Joe go sullenly on  his dressing. And  it was discomforting to see  eying Joe’s preparations so wistfully, and keeping up  an ominous silence. Presently, without a parting , Joe began to  off toward the Illinois shore. Tom’s heart began to . He glanced at .  could not  the , and dropped his eyes.  he :
“I  to go, too, Tom. It was getting so lonesome anyway, and now it’ll be worse. Let’s us go, too, Tom.”
“I won’t! You can all go, if you  to. I  to .”
“Tom, I better go.”

“Tom, I wisht you’d , too. Now you think it over. We’ll  for you  we get to shore.”
“, you’ll  a blame  , that’s all.”
 started sorrowfully away, and Tom stood looking after him,  a strong desire tugging at his heart to yield his pride and go along too. He hoped the  would , but  still waded slowly on. It suddenly dawned on Tom  it was become  lonely and still. He  one final struggle  his pride, and  darted after his comrades, yelling:
“! ! I  to  you something!”
 presently stopped and turned around.  he got to where  , he began unfolding his secret, and  listened moodily  at   saw the “point” he was driving at, and   set up a warwhoop of applause and  it was “splendid!” and  if he had   at first,  wouldn’t  started away.

Joe caught at the idea and  he would  to try, too. So   pipes and filled . These novices had never smoked anything before but cigars  of grapevine, and  “bit” the tongue, and  not considered manly anyway.
Now  stretched themselves out on their elbows and began to , charily, and  slender confidence. The smoke had an unpleasant taste, and  gagged a little, but Tom :
“Why, it’s  as easy! If I’d a knowed  was all, I’d a learnt  ago.”
“So would I,”  Joe. “It’s  nothing.”
“Why,  a  I’ve looked at people smoking, and thought  I  I could do ; but I never thought I could,”  Tom.
“That’s  the way  me, hain’t it, ? You’ve heard me    way—haven’t you, ? I’ll leave it to  if I haven’t.”
“Yes—heaps of times,”  .
“, I  too,”  Tom; “oh, hundreds of times. Once  by the slaughter-house. Don’t you remember, ? Bob Tanner was there, and Johnny Miller, and  Thatcher,  I  it. Don’t you remember, , ’bout me saying ?”
“Yes, that’s so,”  . “ was the day after I  a white alley. No, ’twas the day before.”
“There—I  you so,”  Tom. “ recollects it.”
“I bleeve I could smoke   all day,”  Joe. “I don’t  .”
“Neither do I,”  Tom. “I could smoke it all day. But I bet you  Thatcher couldn’t.”
“ Thatcher! Why,   over   two draws.  let him try it once.  see!”
“I bet he would. And Johnny Miller—I  could see Johnny Miller tackle it once.”
“Oh, don’t I!”  Joe. “Why, I bet you Johnny Miller couldn’t any  do   nothing.  one little snifter would fetch him.”
“’Deed it would, Joe. Say—I  the  could see us now.”
“So do I.”
“Say—, don’t say anything about it, and    they’re around, I’ll  up to you and say, ‘Joe, got a ? I  a smoke.’ And you’ll say,  of careless , as if it warn’t anything, you’ll say, ‘Yes, I got my old , and another one, but my tobacker ain’t  .’ And I’ll say, ‘Oh, that’s all right, if it’s strong enough.’ And  you’ll out  the pipes, and we’ll light up  as , and   see ’em !”
“By jings, that’ll be gay, Tom! I  it was now!”
“So do I! And  we  ’em we learned  we was off pirating, won’t   they’d  along?”
“Oh, I reckon not! I’ll  bet  !”
So the  ran on. But presently it began to  a trifle, and  disjointed. The silences widened; the expectoration marvellously increased.

CHAPTER 
BUT there was no hilarity in the little    tranquil Saturday afternoon. The Harpers, and Aunt Polly’s family,  being put into mourning,  great grief and  tears. An unusual quiet possessed the village, although it was ordinarily quiet enough, in all conscience. The villagers conducted their concerns  an absent air, and talked little; but  sighed often. The Saturday holiday seemed a burden to the children.  had no heart in their sports, and gradually   up.
In the afternoon Becky Thatcher found herself moping about the deserted schoolhouse , and feeling  melancholy. But she found nothing there to comfort her. She soliloquized:
“Oh, if I only had a brass andiron- again! But I haven’t got anything now to remember him by.” And she choked  a little sob.
Presently she stopped, and  to herself:
“It was right . Oh, if it was to do over again, I wouldn’t say —I wouldn’t say it for the whole world. But   now; I’ll never, never, never see him any .”
 thought broke her , and she wandered away,  tears rolling  her cheeks.  quite a group of  and girls—playmates of Tom’s and Joe’s— by, and stood looking over the paling fence and talking in reverent tones of how Tom did so-and-so the    saw him, and how Joe   and  small trifle (pregnant  awful prophecy, as  could easily see now!)—and each speaker pointed out the exact  where the   stood at the , and  added something  “and I was a-standing  so— as I am now, and as if you was him—I was as close as —and he smiled,   way—and  something seemed to go all over me, —awful, you —and I never thought  it meant, of course, but I can see now!”
 there was a dispute about who saw the    in , and  claimed  dismal distinction, and offered evidences,  or  tampered  by the witness; and  it was ultimately decided who did see the departed , and exchanged the  words  , the lucky parties  upon themselves a  of sacred importance, and  gaped at and envied by all the . One  , who had no other grandeur to offer,   tolerably manifest pride in the remembrance:

The villagers began to gather, loitering a moment in the vestibule to converse in whispers about the sad event. But there was no whispering in the house; only the funereal rustling of dresses as the women gathered to their seats disturbed the silence there.  could remember  the little church had  so  before. There was finally a waiting pause, an expectant dumbness, and  Aunt Polly entered, followed by Sid and , and  by the Harper family, all in  black, and the whole congregation, the old minister as ,  reverently and stood until the mourners  seated in the front pew. There was another communing silence, broken at intervals by muffled , and  the minister spread his hands abroad and prayed. A moving  was , and the  followed: “I am the Resurrection and the .”
As the service proceeded, the clergyman   pictures of the graces, the winning , and the  promise of the    every  there, thinking he recognized these pictures,  a  in remembering  he had persistently blinded himself to  always before, and had as persistently  only faults and flaws in the  . The minister related  a touching incident in the lives of the departed, too, which illustrated their sweet, generous natures, and the people could easily see, now, how noble and beautiful those episodes , and remembered  grief  at the   occurred  had seemed  rascalities,  deserving of the cowhide. The congregation became  and  moved, as the pathetic   on,  at  the whole company broke  and joined the weeping mourners in a chorus of anguished , the preacher himself giving way to his feelings, and crying in the pulpit.
There was a rustle in the gallery, which nobody noticed; a moment later the church  creaked; the minister raised his streaming eyes above his handkerchief, and stood transfixed! First one and  another  of eyes followed the minister’s, and  almost  one impulse the congregation  and stared while the three    marching up the aisle, Tom in the , Joe , and , a  of drooping , sneaking sheepishly in the !  had  hid in the unused gallery listening to their own funeral sermon!
Aunt Polly, , and the Harpers threw themselves upon their restored ones, smothered   kisses and poured out thanksgivings, while   stood abashed and uncomfortable, not knowing exactly  to do or where to   so  unwelcoming eyes. He wavered, and started to slink away, but Tom seized him and :
“Aunt Polly, it ain’t . Somebody’s got to be  to see .”
“And so  shall. I’m  to see him,  motherless thing!” And the loving attentions Aunt Polly lavished upon him  the one thing capable of making him  uncomfortable  he was before.
Suddenly the minister shouted at the top of his voice: “Praise God   all blessings —!—and put  hearts in it!”
And  did. Old Hundred swelled up  a triumphant burst, and while it shook the rafters Tom Sawyer the Pirate looked around upon the envying juveniles about him and confessed in his heart   was the proudest moment of his .
As the “” congregation trooped out    would almost be willing to be  ridiculous again to  Old Hundred    once .

CHAPTER XVIII
 was Tom’s great secret—the scheme to return   his brother pirates and attend their own funerals.  had paddled over to the Missouri shore on a log, at  on Saturday, landing  or six miles below the village;  had slept in the woods at the edge of the   nearly daylight, and had  crept through  lanes and alleys and finished their sleep in the gallery of the church among a chaos of invalided benches.
At breakfast, Monday morning, Aunt Polly and    loving to Tom, and  attentive to his wants. There was an unusual amount of . In the course of it Aunt Polly :
“, I don’t say it wasn’t a  , Tom, to  everybody suffering ’most a  so you  had a  , but it is a  you could be so -hearted as to let me suffer so. If you could  over on a log to go to  funeral, you could   over and  me a   way  you warn’t , but only run off.”
“Yes, you could   , Tom,”  ; “and I believe you would if you had thought of it.”
“Would you, Tom?”  Aunt Polly, her  lighting wistfully. “Say, now, would you, if you’d thought of it?”
“I—, I don’t . ’Twould ’a’ spoiled everything.”
“Tom, I hoped you loved me  ,”  Aunt Polly,  a grieved   discomforted the boy. “It would   something if you’d cared enough to think of it, even if you didn’t do it.”
“Now, auntie,  ain’t any ,” pleaded ; “it’s only Tom’s giddy way—he is always in  a   he never thinks of anything.”
“More’s the . Sid would  thought. And Sid would   and  it, too. Tom, you’ll  ,  day,  it’s too , and  you’d cared a little  for me  it would   you so little.”
“Now, auntie, you  I do  for you,”  Tom.
“I’d  it better if you acted   it.”
“I  now I’d thought,”  Tom,  a repentant ; “but I dreamt about you, anyway. That’s something, ain’t it?”
“It ain’t —a cat   —but it’s better  nothing.  did you dream?”
“Why, Wednesday night I dreamt  you was sitting over there by the bed, and Sid was sitting by the woodbox, and   to him.”
“, so we did. So we always do. I’m   dreams could  even   trouble about us.”
“And I dreamt  Joe Harper’s mother was .”
“Why, she was ! Did you dream any ?”
“Oh, . But it’s so dim, now.”
“, try to recollect—can’t you?”
“Somehow it seems to me  the —the  blowed the—the—”
“Try harder, Tom! The  did  something. !”
Tom pressed his fingers on his forehead an anxious minute, and  :
“I’ve got it now! I’ve got it now! It blowed the candle!”
“Mercy on us! Go on, Tom—go on!”
“And it seems to me  you , ‘Why, I believe   —‘”
“Go on, Tom!”
“ let me study a moment— a moment. Oh, yes—you  you believed the  was open.”
“As I’m sitting , I did! Didn’t I, ! Go on!”
“And —and — I won’t be certain, but it seems  as if you  Sid go and—and—”
“? ?  did I  him do, Tom?  did I  him do?”
“You  him—you—Oh, you  him  it.”
“, for the land’s ! I never heard the  of  in all my ! Don’t  me there ain’t anything in dreams, any . Sereny Harper shall  of  before I’m an  older. I’d  to see her get around   her rubbage ’bout superstition. Go on, Tom!”
“Oh, it’s all getting  as bright as day, now.  you  I warn’t bad, only mischeevous and harum-scarum, and not any  responsible ——I think it was a , or something.”
“And so it was! , goodness gracious! Go on, Tom!”
“And  you began to cry.”
“So I did. So I did. Not the first , neither. And —”
“ Mrs. Harper she began to cry, and  Joe was  the , and she wished she hadn’t whipped him for taking cream  she’d throwed it out her own —”
“Tom! The sperrit was upon you! You was a prophesying—that’s  you was doing!  alive, go on, Tom!”
“ Sid he —he —”
“I don’t think I  anything,”  Sid.
“Yes you did, Sid,”  .
“  heads and let Tom go on!  did he say, Tom?”
“He —I think he  he hoped I was better off where I was  to, but if I’d  better sometimes—”
“There, d’you  ! It was his  words!”
“And you  him up sharp.”
“I lay I did! There  ’a’  an angel there. There was an angel there, somewheres!”
“And Mrs. Harper  about Joe scaring her  a firecracker, and you  about Peter and the -killer—”
“ as  as I !”
“And  there was a whole lot of  ’bout dragging the river for us, and ’bout having the funeral Sunday, and  you and old  Harper hugged and cried, and she .”
“It happened  so! It happened  so, as  as I’m a-sitting in these  tracks. Tom, you couldn’t  it   if you’d ’a’  it! And  ? Go on, Tom!”
“ I thought you prayed for me—and I could see you and  every  you . And you  to bed, and I was so sorry  I  and wrote on a piece of sycamore , ‘We ain’t —we are only off being pirates,’ and put it on the table by the candle; and  you looked so , laying there asleep,  I thought I  and leaned over and kissed you on the .”
“Did you, Tom, did you! I  forgive you everything for !” And she seized the boy in a crushing embrace   him   the guiltiest of villains.
“It was  , even though it was only a—dream,” Sid soliloquized  audibly.
“ up, Sid! A    the  in a dream as  do if he was awake. Here’s a big Milum apple I’ve  saving for you, Tom, if you was ever found again—now go ’long to school. I’m thankful to the  God and Father of us all I’ve got you , that’s -suffering and merciful to   believe on Him and  His , though goodness knows I’m unworthy of it, but if only the worthy ones got His blessings and had His  to   over the rough places, there’s few enough would smile  or ever enter into His   the  night comes. Go ’long Sid, , Tom— yourselves off—you’ve hendered me  enough.”
The children  for school, and the old  to  on Mrs. Harper and vanquish her realism  Tom’s marvellous dream. Sid had better judgment  to utter the thought  was in his  as he  the house. It was : “Pretty —as  a dream as , without any mistakes in it!”
 a  Tom was become, now! He did not go skipping and prancing, but moved  a dignified swagger as became a pirate who   the public eye was on him. And indeed it was; he tried not to  to see the looks or  the remarks as he passed along, but    and drink to him. Smaller   himself flocked at his heels, as proud to be   him, and tolerated by him, as if he had  the drummer at the  of a procession or the elephant leading a menagerie into .  of his own  pretended not to  he had  away at all; but   consuming  envy, nevertheless.  would  given anything to   swarthy sun-tanned  of his, and his glittering notoriety; and Tom would not  parted  either for a circus.
At school the children  so  of him and of Joe, and delivered  eloquent admiration  their eyes,  the two heroes  not  in becoming insufferably “stuck-up.”  began to  their adventures to hungry listeners—but  only began; it was not a thing likely to  an end,  imaginations  theirs to furnish material. And finally,   got out their pipes and  serenely puffing around, the  summit of glory was reached.
Tom decided  he could be independent of Becky Thatcher now. Glory was sufficient. He would  for glory. Now  he was distinguished, maybe she would be wanting to “ up.” , let her—she should see  he could be as indifferent as  other people. Presently she arrived. Tom pretended not to see her. He moved away and joined a group of  and girls and began to .  he observed  she was tripping gayly  and forth  flushed  and dancing eyes, pretending to be  chasing schoolmates, and screaming  laughter  she  a capture; but he noticed  she always  her captures in his vicinity, and  she seemed to  a conscious eye in his direction at  times, too. It gratified all the vicious vanity  was in him; and so, instead of winning him, it only “set him up” the  and  him the  diligent to avoid betraying  he  she was about. Presently she  over skylarking, and moved irresolutely about, sighing once or twice and glancing furtively and wistfully toward Tom.  she observed  now Tom was talking  particularly to Amy Lawrence  to any one else. She  a sharp  and  disturbed and uneasy at once. She tried to go away, but her   treacherous, and carried her to the group instead. She  to a  almost at Tom’s elbow—  vivacity:
“Why,  Austin! you bad , why didn’t you  to Sunday-school?”
“I did —didn’t you see me?”
“Why, no! Did you? Where did you sit?”
“I was in  Peters’ class, where I always go. I saw you.”
“Did you? Why, it’s funny I didn’t see you. I wanted to  you about the picnic.”
“Oh, that’s jolly. Who’s going to  it?”
“My  going to let me  one.”
“Oh, goody; I  she’ll let me .”
“, she . The picnic’s for me. She’ll let anybody   I , and I  you.”
“That’s ever so .  is it going to be?”
“By and by. Maybe about vacation.”
“Oh, won’t it be fun! You going to  all the girls and ?”
“Yes, every one that’s friends to me—or wants to be”; and she glanced ever so furtively at Tom, but he talked right along to Amy Lawrence about the terrible storm on the island, and how the lightning  the great sycamore  “all to flinders” while he was “standing within three  of it.”
“Oh, may I ?”  Grace Miller.
“Yes.”
“And me?”  Sally Rogers.
“Yes.”
“And me, too?”   Harper. “And Joe?”
“Yes.”
And so on,  clapping of joyful hands  all the group had begged for invitations but Tom and Amy.  Tom turned coolly away, still talking, and  Amy  him. Becky’s  trembled and the tears  to her eyes; she hid these signs  a forced gayety and  on chattering, but the  had  out of the picnic, now, and out of everything else; she got away as  as she could and hid herself and had  her sex  “a  cry.”  she sat moody,  wounded pride,  the  . She roused up, now,  a vindictive  in her eye, and  her plaited tails a shake and  she   she’d do.
At recess Tom continued his flirtation  Amy  jubilant -satisfaction. And he  drifting about to  Becky and lacerate her  the performance. At  he spied her, but there was a sudden falling of his mercury. She was sitting cosily on a little bench behind the schoolhouse looking at a picture-  Alfred Temple—and so absorbed  , and their heads so close together over the ,   did not  to be conscious of anything in the world besides. Jealousy ran red-hot through Tom’s veins. He began to  himself for throwing away the chance Becky had offered for a reconciliation. He called himself a , and all the  names he could think of. He wanted to cry  vexation. Amy chatted happily along, as  walked, for her heart was singing, but Tom’s tongue had  its function. He did not   Amy was saying, and whenever she paused expectantly he could only stammer an awkward assent, which was as often misplaced as otherwise. He  drifting to the  of the schoolhouse, again and again, to  his eyeballs  the hateful spectacle there. He could not  it. And it maddened him to see, as he thought he saw,  Becky Thatcher never once suspected  he was even in the  of the living. But she did see, nevertheless; and she  she was winning her fight, too, and was  to see him suffer as she had suffered.
Amy’s happy prattle became intolerable. Tom hinted at things he had to attend to; things   be ; and  was fleeting. But in —the  chirped on. Tom thought, “Oh,  her, ain’t I ever going to get rid of her?” At  he  be attending to those things—and she  artlessly  she would be “around”  school let out. And he hastened away, hating her for it.
“Any other boy!” Tom thought, grating his teeth. “Any boy in the whole  but  Saint Louis smarty  thinks he dresses so  and is aristocracy! Oh, all right, I licked you the first day you ever saw  , mister, and I’ll  you again! You    I catch you out! I’ll   and—”
And he  through the motions of thrashing an imaginary boy—pummelling the air, and kicking and gouging. “Oh, you do, do you? You holler ’nough, do you? Now, , let  learn you!” And so the imaginary flogging was finished to his satisfaction.
Tom   at . His conscience could not endure any  of Amy’s grateful happiness, and his jealousy could  no  of the other distress. Becky resumed her picture inspections  Alfred, but as the minutes dragged along and no Tom  to suffer, her triumph began to cloud and she  interest; gravity and absentmindedness followed, and  melancholy; two or three times she pricked up her ear at a footstep, but it was a false ; no Tom . At  she  entirely miserable and wished she hadn’t carried it so far.   Alfred, seeing  he was losing her, he did not  how,  exclaiming: “Oh, here’s a jolly one!  at !” she  patience at , and , “Oh, don’t bother me! I don’t  for !” and burst into tears, and got up and walked away.
Alfred dropped alongside and was going to try to comfort her, but she :
“Go away and leave me alone, can’t you! I  you!”
So the boy halted, wondering  he could  —for she had  she would  at pictures all through the nooning—and she walked on, crying.  Alfred  musing into the deserted schoolhouse. He was humiliated and angry. He easily guessed his way to the truth—the  had simply  a convenience of him to  her spite upon Tom Sawyer. He was far  hating Tom the    thought occurred to him. He wished there was  way to get  boy into trouble without   to himself. Tom’s spelling-  under his eye.  was his opportunity. He gratefully opened to the lesson for the afternoon and poured ink upon the .
Becky, glancing in at a window behind him at the moment, saw the act, and moved on, without discovering herself. She started homeward, now, intending to  Tom and  him; Tom would be thankful and their troubles would be healed. Before she was  way , however, she had changed her . The thought of Tom’s treatment of her  she was talking about her picnic  scorching  and filled her  shame. She resolved to let him get whipped on the damaged spelling-book’s account, and to  him forever, into the bargain.
CHAPTER XIX
TOM arrived at  in a dreary , and the first thing his aunt  to him showed him  he had brought his sorrows to an unpromising market:
“Tom, I’ve a notion to  you alive!”
“Auntie,   I ?”
“, you’ve  enough.  I go over to Sereny Harper,  an old softy, expecting I’m going to  her believe all  rubbage about  dream,  lo and behold you she’d found out  Joe  you was over  and heard all the  we had  night. Tom, I don’t   is to become of a boy   act  . It makes me  so bad to think you could let me go to Sereny Harper and   a  of myself and never say a .”
 was a new aspect of the thing. His smartness of the morning had seemed to Tom a   before, and  ingenious. It merely looked  and shabby now. He  his  and could not think of anything to say for a moment.  he :
“Auntie, I  I hadn’t  it—but I didn’t think.”
“Oh, child, you never think. You never think of anything but  own selfishness. You could think to  all the way over   Jackson’s Island in the night to laugh at our troubles, and you could think to  me  a lie about a dream; but you couldn’t ever think to  us and  us  sorrow.”
“Auntie, I  now it was , but I didn’t  to be . I didn’t, honest. And besides, I didn’t  over  to laugh at you  night.”
“ did you  for, ?”
“It was to  you not to be uneasy about us, because we hadn’t got drownded.”
“Tom, Tom, I would be the thankfullest  in  world if I could believe you ever had as  a thought as , but you  you never did—and I  it, Tom.”
“Indeed and ’deed I did, auntie—I  I may never  if I didn’t.”
“Oh, Tom, don’t lie—don’t do it. It only makes things a hundred times worse.”
“It ain’t a lie, auntie; it’s the truth. I wanted to  you  grieving— was all   me .”
“I’d  the whole world to believe —it would cover up a power of , Tom. I’d ’most be  you’d run off and acted so bad. But it ain’t reasonable; because, why didn’t you  me, child?”
“Why, you see,  you got to talking about the funeral, I  got all  of the idea of our coming and hiding in the church, and I couldn’t somehow  to spoil it. So I  put the   in my pocket and  mum.”
“ ?”
“The  I had wrote on to  you   pirating. I , now, you’d waked up  I kissed you—I do, honest.”
The  lines in his aunt’s  relaxed and a sudden tenderness dawned in her eyes.
“Did you  me, Tom?”
“Why, yes, I did.”
“Are you  you did, Tom?”
“Why, yes, I did, auntie—certain .”
“ did you  me for, Tom?”
“Because I loved you so, and you  there moaning and I was so sorry.”
The words sounded  truth. The old  could not  a tremor in her voice  she :
“ me again, Tom!—and be off  you to school, now, and don’t bother me any .”
The moment he was , she ran to a closet and got out the  of a jacket which Tom had  pirating in.  she stopped,  it in her , and  to herself:
“No, I don’t .  boy, I reckon   about it—but it’s a blessed, blessed lie, there’s  a comfort   it. I  the —I  the   forgive him, because it was  -heartedness in him to  it. But I don’t  to  out it’s a lie. I won’t .”
She put the jacket away, and stood by musing a minute. Twice she put out her  to  the garment again, and twice she refrained. Once  she ventured, and   she fortified herself  the thought: “It’s a  lie—it’s a  lie—I won’t let it grieve me.” So she sought the jacket pocket. A moment later she was reading Tom’s piece of  through flowing tears and saying: “I could forgive the boy, now, if  committed a million !”
CHAPTER XX
THERE was something about Aunt Polly’s manner,  she kissed Tom,  swept away his low spirits and  him lighthearted and happy again. He started to school and had the  of coming upon Becky Thatcher at the  of Meadow . His  always determined his manner. Without a moment’s hesitation he ran to her and :
“I acted mighty  today, Becky, and I’m so sorry. I won’t ever, ever do  way again, as  as ever I —please  up, won’t you?”
The  stopped and looked him scornfully in the :
“I’ll thank you to  yourself to yourself, Mr. Thomas Sawyer. I’ll never speak to you again.”
She tossed her  and passed on. Tom was so stunned  he had not even presence of  enough to say “Who cares,  Smarty?” until the right  to say it had  by. So he  nothing. But he was in a  , nevertheless. He moped into the schoolyard wishing she  a boy, and imagining how he would trounce her if she . He presently encountered her and delivered a stinging remark as he passed. She hurled one in return, and the angry breach was complete. It seemed to Becky, in her hot resentment,  she could hardly  for school to “ in,” she was so impatient to see Tom flogged for the injured spelling-. If she had had any lingering notion of exposing Alfred Temple, Tom’s offensive fling had driven it entirely away.
 , she did not  how  she was nearing trouble herself. The master, Mr. Dobbins, had reached middle age  an unsatisfied ambition. The darling of his desires was, to be a doctor, but poverty had decreed  he should be nothing higher  a village schoolmaster. Every day he  a mysterious  out of his  and absorbed himself in it at times  no classes  reciting. He    under  and key. There was not an urchin in school but was perishing to  a glimpse of it, but the chance never . Every boy and  had a theory about the nature of  ; but no two theories  alike, and there was no way of getting at the facts in the . Now, as Becky was passing by the , which stood  the , she noticed  the key was in the ! It was a precious moment. She glanced around; found herself alone, and the  instant she had the  in her hands. The titlepage—Professor Somebody’s Anatomy—carried no information to her ; so she began to  the leaves. She  at once upon a handsomely engraved and colored frontispiece—a human figure, stark naked. At  moment a shadow  on the  and Tom Sawyer stepped in at the  and caught a glimpse of the picture. Becky snatched at the  to close it, and had the   to  the pictured    the middle. She thrust the volume into the , turned the key, and burst out crying  shame and vexation.
“Tom Sawyer, you are  as  as you can be, to sneak up on a person and  at  they’re looking at.”
“How could I  you was looking at anything?”
“You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Tom Sawyer; you  you’re going to  on me, and oh,  shall I do,  shall I do! I’ll be whipped, and I never was whipped in school.”
 she stamped her little  and :
“Be so  if you  to! I  something that’s going to happen. You   and you’ll see! Hateful, hateful, hateful!”—and she flung out of the house  a new explosion of crying.
Tom stood still, rather flustered by  onslaught. Presently he  to himself:
“ a curious  of a  a  is! Never  licked in school! Shucks! What’s a licking! That’s   a —they’re so -skinned and chicken-hearted. , of course I ain’t going to  old Dobbins on  little , because there’s other  of getting even on her,  ain’t so ; but  of it? Old Dobbins  ask who it was  his . Nobody’ll answer.  he’ll do  the way he always —ask first one and  t’other, and  he comes to the right  he’ll  it, without any telling. Girls’ faces always  on .  ain’t got any backbone. She’ll get licked. , it’s a  of a tight place for Becky Thatcher, because there ain’t any way out of it.” Tom conned the thing a moment longer, and  added: “All right, though; she’d  to see me in   a fix—let her sweat it out!”
Tom joined the mob of skylarking scholars outside. In a few moments the master arrived and school “ in.” Tom did not  a strong interest in his studies. Every  he stole a glance at the girls’  of the  Becky’s  troubled him. Considering all things, he did not  to  her, and yet it was all he could do to  it. He could get up no exultation  was really worthy the . Presently the spelling- discovery was , and Tom’s  was entirely  of his own matters for a while after . Becky roused up  her lethargy of distress and showed  interest in the proceedings. She did not expect  Tom could get out of his trouble by denying  he spilt the ink on the  himself; and she was right. The denial only seemed to  the thing worse for Tom. Becky supposed she would be  of , and she tried to believe she was  of it, but she found she was not certain.  the worst  to the worst, she had an impulse to get up and  on Alfred Temple, but she  an effort and forced herself to  still—because,  she to herself, “he’ll  about me tearing the picture . I wouldn’t say a , not to  his !”
Tom  his whipping and   to his  not at all broken-hearted, for he thought it was possible  he had unknowingly upset the ink on the spelling- himself, in  skylarking —he had denied it for form’s  and because it was custom, and had stuck to the denial  principle.
A whole  drifted by, the master sat nodding in his throne, the air was drowsy  the hum of study. By and by, Mr. Dobbins straightened himself up, yawned,  unlocked his , and reached for his , but seemed undecided whether to  it out or leave it.  of the pupils glanced up languidly, but there  two among   watched his movements  intent eyes. Mr. Dobbins fingered his  absently for a while,   it out and settled himself in his chair to ! Tom  a glance at Becky. He had  a hunted and helpless rabbit  as she did,  a gun levelled at its . Instantly he forgot his quarrel  her. Quick—something  be !  in a flash, too! But the  imminence of the emergency paralyzed his invention. !—he had an inspiration! He would run and snatch the , spring through the  and fly. But his resolution shook for one little instant, and the chance was —the master opened the volume. If Tom only had the wasted opportunity  again! Too . There was no  for Becky now, he . The  moment the master faced the school. Every eye  under his . There was  in it which smote even the innocent  . There was silence while one might count ten—the master was gathering his wrath.  he spoke: “Who   ?”
There was not a sound. One could  heard a pin . The stillness continued; the master searched  after  for signs of guilt.
“Benjamin Rogers, did you   ?”
A denial. Another pause.
“Joseph Harper, did you?”
Another denial. Tom’s uneasiness   and  intense under the  torture of these proceedings. The master scanned the ranks of —considered a while,  turned to the girls:
“Amy Lawrence?”
A shake of the .
“Gracie Miller?”
The  .
“Susan Harper, did you do ?”
Another negative. The   was Becky Thatcher. Tom was trembling   to   excitement and a sense of the hopelessness of the situation.
“Rebecca Thatcher” [Tom glanced at her —it was white  terror]—“did you —no,  me in the ” [her hands  in appeal]—“did you   ?”
A thought   lightning through Tom’s brain. He sprang to his  and shouted—“I  it!”
The school stared in perplexity at  incredible folly. Tom stood a moment, to gather his dismembered faculties; and  he stepped forward to go to his punishment the surprise, the gratitude, the adoration  shone upon him out of  Becky’s eyes seemed pay enough for a hundred floggings. Inspired by the splendor of his own act, he  without an outcry the  merciless flaying  even Mr. Dobbins had ever administered; and also received  indifference the added cruelty of a command to remain two hours after school should be dismissed—for he  who would  for him outside  his captivity was , and not count the tedious  as , either.
Tom  to bed  night planning vengeance against Alfred Temple; for  shame and repentance Becky had  him all, not forgetting her own treachery; but even the longing for vengeance had to  way, , to pleasanter musings, and he  asleep at   Becky’s latest words lingering dreamily in his ear—
“Tom, how could you be so noble!”
CHAPTER XXI
VACATION was approaching. The schoolmaster, always severe,  severer and  exacting  ever, for he wanted the school to  a  showing on “Examination” day. His rod and his ferule  seldom idle now—at least among the smaller pupils. Only the biggest , and young ladies of eighteen and twenty, escaped lashing.

In the fulness of  the interesting occasion arrived. At eight in the evening the schoolhouse was brilliantly lighted, and adorned  wreaths and festoons of foliage and flowers. The master sat throned in his great chair upon a raised platform,  his blackboard behind him. He was looking tolerably mellow. Three  of benches on each  and six  in front of him  occupied by the dignitaries of the  and by the parents of the pupils. To his ,  of the  of citizens, was a spacious temporary platform upon which  seated the scholars who  to   in the exercises of the evening;  of small , washed and dressed to an intolerable state of discomfort;  of gawky big ; snowbanks of girls and young ladies  in  and muslin and conspicuously conscious of their  arms, their grandmothers’ ancient trinkets, their  of  and  ribbon and the flowers in their . All the  of the house was filled  non-participating scholars.
The exercises began. A  little boy stood up and sheepishly recited, “You’d scarce expect one of my age to speak in public on the stage,” etc.—accompanying himself  the painfully exact and spasmodic gestures which a machine might  used—supposing the machine to be a trifle out of order. But he got through safely, though cruelly scared, and got a  round of applause  he  his manufactured bow and retired.
A little shamefaced  lisped, “ had a little ,” etc., performed a compassion-inspiring curtsy, got her  of applause, and sat  flushed and happy.
Tom Sawyer stepped forward  conceited confidence and soared into the unquenchable and indestructible “ me liberty or  me death” speech,    and frantic gesticulation, and broke  in the middle of it. A ghastly stage-fright seized him, his  quaked under him and he was  to choke. , he had the manifest sympathy of the house but he had the house’s silence, too, which was even worse  its sympathy. The master frowned, and  completed the disaster. Tom struggled awhile and  retired, utterly defeated. There was a  attempt at applause, but it  early.
“The Boy Stood on the Burning ” followed; also “The Assyrian  ,” and other declamatory .  there  reading exercises, and a spelling fight. The meagre Latin class recited  honor. The prime feature of the evening was in order, now—original “compositions” by the young ladies. Each in her  stepped forward to the edge of the platform, cleared her throat,  up her manuscript (  dainty ribbon), and proceeded to ,  labored attention to “expression” and punctuation. The themes  the   had  illuminated upon similar occasions by their mothers before , their grandmothers, and doubtless all their ancestors in the female  clear  to the Crusades. “Friendship” was one; “Memories of Other ”; “Religion in History”; “Dream ”; “The Advantages of Culture”; “Forms of Political Government Compared and Contrasted”; “Melancholy”; “Filial ”; “Heart Longings,” etc., etc.
A prevalent feature in these compositions was a nursed and petted melancholy; another was a wasteful and opulent  of “ language”; another was a tendency to lug in by the ears particularly prized words and phrases until    entirely out; and a peculiarity  conspicuously marked and marred  was the inveterate and intolerable sermon  wagged its crippled  at the end of each and every one of . No matter  the subject might be, a brainracking effort was  to squirm it into  aspect or other  the moral and religious  could contemplate  edification. The glaring insincerity of these sermons was not sufficient to compass the banishment of the fashion  the schools, and it is not sufficient today; it never  be sufficient while the world stands, perhaps. There is no school in all our  where the young ladies do not  obliged to close their compositions  a sermon; and you    the sermon of the  frivolous and the least religious  in the school is always the longest and the  relentlessly pious. But enough of . Homely truth is unpalatable.
Let us return to the “Examination.” The first composition  was  was one entitled “Is , , ?” Perhaps the reader can endure an extract  it:
“In the common walks of ,   delightful emotions  the youthful   forward to  anticipated scene of festivity! Imagination is  sketching -tinted pictures of joy. In fancy, the voluptuous votary of fashion  herself amid the festive throng, ‘the observed of all observers.’ Her graceful , arrayed in snowy robes, is whirling through the mazes of the joyous dance; her eye is brightest, her  is lightest in the gay assembly.

And so forth and so on. There was a  of gratification   to  during the reading, accompanied by whispered ejaculations of “How sweet!” “How eloquent!” “So !” etc., and after the thing had closed  a peculiarly afflicting sermon the applause was enthusiastic.

CHAPTER 
TOM joined the new order of Cadets of Temperance, being attracted by the showy character of their “regalia.” He promised to abstain  smoking, chewing, and profanity as  as he remained a member. Now he found out a new thing—namely,  to promise not to do a thing is the surest way in the world to  a   to go and do   thing. Tom  found himself tormented  a desire to drink and swear; the desire  to be so intense  nothing but the  of a chance to display himself in his red   him  withdrawing  the order. Fourth of  was coming; but he    up— it up before he had  his shackles over forty-eight hours—and fixed his hopes upon old Judge Frazer, justice of the peace, who was apparently on his deathbed and would  a big public funeral, since he was so  an official. During three  Tom was deeply concerned about the Judge’s condition and hungry for  of it. Sometimes his hopes ran —so   he would venture to get out his regalia and practise before the looking-glass. But the Judge had a  discouraging way of fluctuating. At  he was pronounced upon the —and  convalescent. Tom was disgusted; and  a sense of injury, too. He handed in his resignation at once—and  night the Judge suffered a relapse and . Tom resolved  he would never trust a man   again.
The funeral was a  thing. The Cadets paraded in a style calculated to  the  member  envy. Tom was a  boy again, however—there was something in . He could drink and swear, now—but found to his surprise  he did not  to. The simple   he could,  the desire away, and the charm of it.
Tom presently wondered to   his coveted vacation was beginning to  a little heavily on his hands.
He attempted a diary—but nothing happened during three , and so he abandoned it.
The first of all the negro minstrel shows  to , and  a sensation. Tom and Joe Harper got up a  of performers and  happy for two .
Even the Glorious Fourth was in  sense a failure, for it rained , there was no procession in consequence, and the greatest man in the world (as Tom supposed), Mr. Benton, an actual United States Senator, proved an overwhelming disappointment—for he was not twenty-  , nor even anywhere in the neighborhood of it.
A circus . The  played circus for three  afterward in tents  of rag carpeting—admission, three  for , two for girls—and  circusing was abandoned.
A phrenologist and a mesmerizer —and  again and  the village duller and drearier  ever.
There   -and-girls’ parties, but   so few and so delightful   only  the aching voids between ache the harder.
Becky Thatcher was  to her Constantinople  to   her parents during vacation—so there was no bright  to  anywhere.
The dreadful secret of the murder was a chronic misery. It was a  cancer for permanency and .

During two  weeks Tom lay a prisoner,  to the world and its happenings. He was  ill, he was interested in nothing.  he got upon his  at  and moved feebly downtown, a melancholy change had  over everything and every creature. There had  a “revival,” and everybody had “got religion,” not only the adults, but even the  and girls. Tom  about, hoping against  for the sight of one blessed sinful , but disappointment crossed him everywhere. He found Joe Harper studying a Testament, and turned sadly away  the depressing spectacle. He sought Ben Rogers, and found him visiting the   a basket of tracts. He hunted up Jim Hollis, who called his attention to the precious blessing of his  measles as a warning. Every boy he encountered added another ton to his depression; and , in desperation, he  for refuge at  to the bosom of Huckleberry  and was received  a Scriptural quotation, his heart broke and he crept  and to bed realizing  he alone of all the  was , forever and forever.
And  night there  on a terrific storm,  driving , awful claps of thunder and blinding sheets of lightning. He covered his   the bedclothes and waited in a horror of suspense for his ; for he had not the shadow of a doubt  all  hubbub was about him. He believed he had taxed the forbearance of the powers above to the extremity of endurance and   was the result. It might  seemed to him a waste of  and ammunition to  a bug  a battery of artillery, but there seemed nothing incongruous about the getting up  an expensive thunderstorm as  to knock the   under an insect  himself.
By and by the tempest spent itself and  without accomplishing its object. The boy’s first impulse was to be grateful, and reform. His second was to —for there might not be any  storms.

The three weeks he spent on his    seemed an entire age.  he got abroad at  he was hardly grateful  he had  spared, remembering how lonely was his estate, how companionless and forlorn he was. He drifted listlessly  the street and found Jim Hollis acting as judge in a juvenile court  was trying a cat for murder, in the presence of her victim, a . He found Joe Harper and   up an alley eating a stolen melon.  ! — Tom—had suffered a relapse.
CHAPTER XXIII
AT  the sleepy atmosphere was stirred—and vigorously: the murder trial  on in the court. It became the absorbing topic of village  immediately. Tom could not get away  it. Every reference to the murder  a shudder to his heart, for his troubled conscience and fears almost persuaded him  these remarks  put forth in his hearing as “feelers”; he did not see how he could be suspected of knowing anything about the murder, but still he could not be comfortable in the midst of  gossip.

Moreover, he wanted to assure himself   had remained discreet.

So  swore again  dread solemnities.

“Yes—so  would. But I  to  ’em abuse him so  the dickens  he never —.”
“I do too, Tom. , I  ’em say  the bloodiest looking villain in  country, and  wonder he wasn’t ever  before.”
“Yes,    , all the . I’ve heard ’em say  if he was to get  they’d lynch him.”

But nothing happened; there seemed to be no angels or fairies interested in  luckless captive.

His gratitude for their gifts had always smote their consciences before—it cut deeper  ever,  .   cowardly and treacherous to the  degree  Potter :
“You’ve  mighty  to me, —better’n anybody else in  . And I don’t forget it, I don’t. Often I  to myself,  I, ‘I used to  all the boys’ kites and things, and  ’em where the  fishin’ places was, and befriend ’em  I could, and now they’ve all forgot old    in trouble; but Tom don’t, and  don’t— don’t forget him,  I, ‘and I don’t forget .’ , , I  an awful thing—drunk and crazy at the —that’s the only way I account for it—and now I got to swing for it, and it’s right.

Tom   miserable, and his dreams  night   of horrors. The  day and the day after, he  about the courtroom, drawn by an almost irresistible impulse to go in, but forcing himself to  out.  was having the  experience.  studiously avoided each other. Each wandered away,   to , but the  dismal fascination always brought   presently. Tom  his ears open  idlers sauntered out of the courtroom, but invariably heard distressing —the toils  closing  and  relentlessly around  Potter. At the end of the second day the village  was to the effect  Injun Joe’s evidence stood  and unshaken, and  there was not the slightest question as to  the jury’s verdict would be.
Tom was out ,  night, and  to bed through the window. He was in a tremendous state of excitement. It was hours before he got to sleep. All the village flocked to the courthouse the  morning, for  was to be the great day.  sexes  about equally represented in the packed audience. After a   the  filed in and  their places; shortly afterward, Potter,  and haggard, timid and hopeless, was brought in,  chains upon him, and seated where all the curious eyes could stare at him; no  conspicuous was Injun Joe, stolid as ever. There was another pause, and  the judge arrived and the sheriff proclaimed the opening of the court. The usual whisperings among the lawyers and gathering together of papers followed. These details and accompanying delays worked up an atmosphere of preparation  was as impressive as it was fascinating.
Now a witness was called who testified  he found  Potter washing in the brook, at an early  of the morning  the murder was discovered, and  he immediately sneaked away. After  further questioning, counsel for the prosecution :
“ the witness.”
The prisoner raised his eyes for a moment, but dropped  again  his own counsel :
“I  no questions to ask him.”
The  witness proved the finding of the knife  the corpse. Counsel for the prosecution :
“ the witness.”
“I  no questions to ask him,” Potter’s lawyer replied.
A third witness swore he had often  the knife in Potter’s possession.
“ the witness.”
Counsel for Potter declined to question him. The faces of the audience began to betray annoyance. Did  attorney  to throw away his client’s  without an effort?
Several witnesses deposed concerning Potter’s guilty behavior  brought to the scene of the murder.   allowed to leave the stand without being cross-questioned.
Every detail of the damaging circumstances  occurred in the graveyard upon  morning which all present remembered so  was brought out by credible witnesses, but  of   cross-examined by Potter’s lawyer. The perplexity and dissatisfaction of the house expressed itself in murmurs and provoked a reproof  the bench. Counsel for the prosecution now :
“By the oaths of citizens whose simple  is above suspicion, we  fastened  awful crime, beyond all possibility of question, upon the unhappy prisoner at the bar. We  our  .”
A groan escaped   Potter, and he put his  in his hands and rocked his  softly to and fro, while a painful silence reigned in the courtroom.  men  moved, and  women’s compassion testified itself in tears. Counsel for the defence  and :
“ honor, in our remarks at the opening of  trial, we foreshadowed our purpose to prove  our client did  fearful  while under the influence of a blind and irresponsible delirium produced by drink. We  changed our . We shall not offer  .” [ to the clerk:] “ Thomas Sawyer!”
A puzzled amazement awoke in every  in the house, not even excepting Potter’s. Every eye fastened itself  wondering interest upon Tom as he  and  his place upon the stand. The boy looked  enough, for he was badly scared. The oath was administered.
“Thomas Sawyer, where  you on the seventeenth of , about the  of midnight?”
Tom glanced at Injun Joe’s iron  and his tongue failed him. The audience listened breathless, but the words refused to . After a few moments, however, the boy got a little of his strength , and managed to put enough of it into his voice to   of the house :
“In the graveyard!”
“A little bit louder, please. Don’t be afraid. You —”
“In the graveyard.”
A contemptuous smile flitted across Injun Joe’s .
“ you anywhere  Horse Williams’ grave?”
“Yes, sir.”
“Speak up— a trifle louder. How   you?”
“ as I am to you.”
“ you hidden, or not?”
“I was hid.”
“Where?”
“Behind the elms that’s on the edge of the grave.”
Injun Joe  a barely perceptible start.
“Any one  you?”
“Yes, sir. I  there —”
“— a moment. Never  mentioning  companion’s . We  produce him at the proper . Did you carry anything there  you.”
Tom hesitated and looked confused.
“Speak out, my boy—don’t be diffident. The truth is always respectable.  did you  there?”
“Only a—a— cat.”
There was a ripple of mirth, which the court checked.
“We  produce the skeleton of  cat. Now, my boy,  us everything  occurred— it in  own way—don’t  anything, and don’t be afraid.”
Tom began—hesitatingly at first, but as he warmed to his subject his words flowed  and  easily; in a little while every sound ceased but his own voice; every eye fixed itself upon him;  parted  and bated breath the audience  upon his words, taking no  of ,  in the ghastly fascinations of the . The strain upon  emotion reached its climax  the boy :
“—and as the doctor fetched the board around and  Potter , Injun Joe jumped  the knife and—”
Crash! Quick as lightning the halfbreed sprang for a window,  his way through all opposers, and was !

So  got a crippled  and a shovel, and set out on their three- tramp.  arrived hot and panting, and threw themselves  in the shade of a neighboring elm to  and  a smoke.
“I  ,”  Tom.
“So do I.”
“Say, , if we  a treasure ,  you going to do   share?”
“, I’ll  pie and a glass of  every day, and I’ll go to every circus  comes along. I bet I’ll  a gay .”
“, ain’t you going to  any of it?”
“ it?  for?”
“Why, so as to  something to  on, by and by.”
“Oh,  ain’t any use. Pap would   to thish-yer   day and get his claws on it if I didn’t hurry up, and I  you  clean it out pretty quick.  you going to do  yourn, Tom?”
“I’m going to buy a new , and a sure’nough sword, and a red necktie and a  pup, and get married.”
“Married!”
“That’s it.”
“Tom, you—why, you ain’t in  right .”
“—you’ll see.”
“, that’s the foolishest thing you could do.  at pap and my mother. Fight! Why,  used to fight all the . I remember, mighty .”
“ ain’t anything. The  I’m going to marry won’t fight.”
“Tom, I reckon they’re all alike. They’ll all  a . Now you better think ’bout  awhile. I  you you better. What’s the  of the gal?”
“It ain’t a gal at all—it’s a .”
“It’s all the , I reckon;   gal,   —both’s right,  enough. Anyway, what’s her , Tom?”
“I’ll  you  —not now.”
“All right—that’ll do. Only if you get married I’ll be  lonesomer  ever.”
“No you won’t. You’ll  and   me. Now  out of  and we’ll go to digging.”

“Do  always  it as  as ?”
“Sometimes—not always. Not generally. I reckon we haven’t got the right place.”
So  chose a new  and began again. The labor dragged a little, but still   progress.  pegged away in silence for  . Finally  leaned on his shovel, swabbed the beaded drops  his   his sleeve, and :
“Where you going to dig , after we get  one?”
“I reckon maybe we’ll tackle the old  that’s over yonder on Cardiff   of the widow’s.”
“I reckon that’ll be a  one. But won’t the widow  it away  us, Tom? It’s on her .”
“She  it away! Maybe she’d  to try it once. Whoever finds one of these hid treasures, it belongs to him. It don’t  any difference whose  it’s on.”
 was satisfactory. The   on. By and by  :
“Blame it, we  be in the wrong place again.  do you think?”
“It is mighty curious, . I don’t understand it. Sometimes witches interfere. I reckon maybe that’s what’s the trouble now.”
“Shucks! Witches ain’t got no power in the daytime.”
“, that’s so. I didn’t think of . Oh, I   the matter is!  a blamed lot of fools we are! You got to  out where the shadow of the  falls at midnight, and that’s where you dig!”
“ consound it, we’ve fooled away all   for nothing. Now  it all, we got to   in the night. It’s an awful  way. Can you get out?”
“I bet I . We’ve got to do it tonight, too, because if somebody  these holes they’ll  in a minute what’s  and they’ll go for it.”
“, I’ll  around and  tonight.”
“All right. Let’s  the tools in the bushes.”
The   there  night, about the appointed .  sat in the shadow waiting. It was a lonely place, and an   solemn by old traditions. Spirits whispered in the rustling leaves, ghosts lurked in the murky nooks, the  baying of a hound floated up out of the distance, an owl answered  his sepulchral . The   subdued by these solemnities, and talked little. By and by  judged  twelve had ;  marked where the shadow , and began to dig. Their hopes commenced to . Their interest  stronger, and their industry    it. The  deepened and still deepened, but every  their hearts jumped to  the  strike upon something,  only suffered a new disappointment. It was only a stone or a chunk. At  Tom :
“It ain’t any use, , we’re wrong again.”
“, but we can’t be wrong. We spotted the shadder to a dot.”
“I  it, but  there’s another thing.”
“What’s ?”.
“Why, we only guessed at the .  enough it was too  or too early.”
 dropped his shovel.
“That’s it,”  he. “That’s the  trouble. We got to   one up. We can’t ever  the right , and besides   of thing’s too awful,    of night  witches and ghosts a-fluttering around so. I  as if something’s behind me all the ; and I’m afeard to  around, becuz maybe there’s others in front a-waiting for a chance. I  creeping all over, ever since I got .”
“, I’ve  pretty  so, too, .   always put in a  man    a treasure under a , to  out for it.”
“Lordy!”
“Yes,  do. I’ve always heard .”
“Tom, I don’t  to  around  where there’s  people. A body’s bound to get into trouble  ’em, .”
“I don’t  to  ’em up, either. S’pose  one  was to stick his skull out and say something!”
“Don’t Tom! It’s awful.”
“, it  is. , I don’t  comfortable a bit.”
“Say, Tom, let’s   place up, and try somewheres else.”
“All right, I reckon we better.”
“What’ll it be?”
Tom considered awhile; and  :
“The ha’nted house. That’s it!”
“Blame it, I don’t  ha’nted houses, Tom. Why, they’re a  sight worse’n  people.  people might , maybe, but  don’t  sliding around in a shroud,  you ain’t noticing, and  over  shoulder all of a sudden and  their teeth, the way a ghost . I couldn’t stand  a thing as , Tom—nobody could.”
“Yes, but, , ghosts don’t travel around only at night.  won’t hender us  digging there in the daytime.”
“, that’s so. But you  mighty  people don’t go about  ha’nted house in the day nor the night.”
“, that’s mostly because  don’t  to go where a man’s  murdered, anyway—but nothing’s ever   around  house except in the night—   lights slipping by the windows—no regular ghosts.”
“, where you see one of   lights flickering around, Tom, you can bet there’s a ghost mighty close behind it. It stands to reason. Becuz you    don’t anybody but ghosts use ’em.”
“Yes, that’s so. But anyway  don’t  around in the daytime, so what’s the use of our being afeard?”
“, all right. We’ll tackle the ha’nted house if you say so—but I reckon it’s taking chances.”
 had started  the  by  . There in the middle of the moonlit valley below  stood the “ha’nted” house, utterly isolated, its fences   ago,  weeds smothering the  doorsteps, the chimney crumbled to , the window-sashes vacant, a corner of the  caved in. The  gazed awhile,  expecting to see a  light   a window;  talking in a low , as befitted the  and the circumstances,  struck far off to the right, to  the haunted house a  berth, and  their way homeward through the woods  adorned the rearward  of Cardiff .

ABOUT  the  day the  arrived at the  ;  had  for their tools. Tom was impatient to go to the haunted house;  was measurably so, also—but suddenly :
“Lookyhere, Tom, do you   day it is?”
Tom mentally ran over the  of the , and  quickly lifted his eyes  a startled  in —
“My! I never once thought of it, !”
“, I didn’t neither, but all at once it popped onto me  it was Friday.”
“Blame it, a  can’t be too careful, . We might ’a’ got into an awful scrape, tackling  a thing on a Friday.”
“Might! Better say we would! There’s  lucky , maybe, but Friday ain’t.”
“Any  knows . I don’t reckon you was the first  found it out, .”
“, I never  I was, did I? And Friday ain’t all, neither. I had a rotten bad dream  night—dreampt about .”
“No!   of trouble. Did  fight?”
“No.”
“, that’s , .   don’t fight it’s only a   there’s trouble around, you . All we got to do is to  mighty sharp and  out of it. We’ll   thing for today, and . Do you  Robin , ?”
“No. Who’s Robin ?”
“Why, he was one of the greatest men  was ever in England—and the . He was a robber.”
“Cracky, I wisht I was. Who did he rob?”
“Only sheriffs and bishops and  people and kings, and  . But he never bothered the . He loved ’em. He always divided up  ’em perfectly square.”
“, he  ’a’  a brick.”
“I bet you he was, . Oh, he was the noblest man  ever was.  ain’t any  men now, I can  you. He could  any man in England,  one   behind him; and he could  his yew bow and  a ten- piece every , a  and a .”
“What’s a yew bow?”
“I don’t . It’s   of a bow, of course. And if he hit   only on the edge he would set  and cry—and curse. But we’ll  Robin —it’s nobby fun. I’ll learn you.”
“I’m agreed.”
So  played Robin  all the afternoon, now and  casting a yearning eye  upon the haunted house and passing a remark about the morrow’s prospects and possibilities there. As the sun began to  into the    their way homeward athwart the  shadows of the trees and   buried  sight in the forests of Cardiff .
On Saturday, shortly after , the   at the   again.  had a smoke and a  in the shade, and  dug a little in their  , not  great , but merely because Tom  there  so  cases where people had given up a treasure after getting  within six inches of it, and  somebody else had  along and turned it up  a single thrust of a shovel. The thing failed  , however, so the  shouldered their tools and  away feeling   had not trifled  fortune, but had fulfilled all the requirements  belong to the business of treasure-hunting.

In a little while familiarity modified their fears and   the place a critical and interested examination, rather admiring their own boldness, and wondering at it, too.   wanted to  upstairs.  was something  cutting off retreat, but  got to daring each other, and of course there could be but one result— threw their tools into a corner and  the ascent. Up there  the  signs of decay. In one corner  found a closet  promised mystery, but the promise was a fraud—there was nothing in it. Their courage was up now and  in .   about to go  and begin  —
“Sh!”  Tom.
“ is it?” whispered , blanching  fright.
“Sh!... There!...  it?”
“Yes!... Oh, my! Let’s run!”
“ still! Don’t you budge! They’re coming right toward the .”
The  stretched themselves upon the floor  their eyes to knotholes in the planking, and lay waiting, in a misery of .
“They’ve stopped.... No—coming....   are. Don’t whisper another , . My goodness, I  I was out of !”
Two men entered. Each boy  to himself: “There’s the old  and  Spaniard that’s  about  once or twice lately—never saw t’other man before.”
“T’other” was a ragged, unkempt creature,  nothing  pleasant in his . The Spaniard was wrapped in a serape; he had bushy white whiskers;  white  flowed  under his sombrero, and he  green goggles.    in, “t’other” was talking in a low voice;  sat  on the ground, facing the ,  their backs to the , and the speaker continued his remarks. His manner became  guarded and his words  distinct as he proceeded:
“No,”  he, “I’ve thought it all over, and I don’t  it. It’s dangerous.”
“Dangerous!” grunted the “ and ” Spaniard—to the  surprise of the . “Milksop!”

“What’s any  dangerous   job up yonder—but nothing’s  of it.”
“That’s different. Away up the river so, and not another house about. ’Twon’t ever be known  we tried, anyway,  as we didn’t succeed.”
“, what’s  dangerous  coming  in the daytime!—anybody would suspicion us  saw us.”
“I  . But there warn’t any other place as handy after   of a job. I  to   shanty. I wanted to yesterday, only it warn’t any use trying to  out of ,  those infernal  playing over there on the  right in  .”

The two men got out   and  a luncheon. After a  and thoughtful silence, Injun Joe :
“ , lad—you go  up the river where you belong.  there  you   me. I’ll  the chances on dropping into    once , for a . We’ll do  ‘dangerous’ job after I’ve spied around a little and think things   for it.  for Texas! We’ll leg it together!”
 was satisfactory.  men presently  to yawning, and Injun Joe :
“I’m  for sleep! It’s   to watch.”
He curled  in the weeds and  began to snore. His comrade stirred him once or twice and he became quiet. Presently the watcher began to nod; his  drooped lower and lower,  men began to snore now.
The   a , grateful breath. Tom whispered:
“Now’s our chance—!”
 :
“I can’t—I’d die if  was to .”
Tom urged—  . At  Tom  slowly and softly, and started alone. But the first  he  wrung  a hideous creak  the crazy floor  he   almost   fright. He never  a second attempt. The  lay there counting the dragging moments  it seemed to     be  and eternity growing ; and    grateful to   at  the sun was setting.
Now one snore ceased. Injun Joe sat up, stared around—smiled grimly upon his comrade, whose  was drooping upon his knees—stirred him up  his  and :
“! You’re a watchman, ain’t you! All right, though—nothing’s happened.”
“My!  I  asleep?”
“Oh, partly, partly. Nearly  for us to be moving, . What’ll we do   little  we’ve got ?”
“I don’t —leave it  as we’ve always , I reckon. No use to  it away  we start south. Six hundred and fifty in silver’s something to carry.”
“—all right—it won’t matter to   once .”
“No—but I’d say  in the night as we used to do—it’s better.”
“Yes: but  ; it may be a  while before I get the right chance at  job; accidents might happen; ’tain’t in  a   place; we’ll  regularly  it—and  it .”
“ idea,”  the comrade, who walked across the , knelt , raised one of the rearward hearth-stones and  out a bag  jingled pleasantly. He subtracted  it twenty or thirty dollars for himself and as  for Injun Joe, and passed the bag to the latter, who was on his knees in the corner, now, digging  his bowie-knife.
The  forgot all their fears, all their miseries in an instant.  gloating eyes  watched every movement. !—the splendor of it was beyond all imagination!

Joe’s knife struck upon something.
“Hello!”  he.
“ is it?”  his comrade.
“-rotten plank—no, it’s a box, I believe. — a  and we’ll see  it’s  for. Never , I’ve broke a .”
He reached his  in and  it out—
“Man, it’s money!”
The two men examined the handful of coins.   . The  above  as excited as themselves, and as delighted.
Joe’s comrade :
“We’ll  quick  of . There’s an old rusty  over amongst the weeds in the corner the other  of the fireplace—I saw it a minute ago.”
He ran and brought the boys’  and shovel. Injun Joe  the , looked it over critically, shook his , muttered something to himself, and  began to use it. The box was  unearthed. It was not  large; it was iron bound and had   strong before the  years had injured it. The men contemplated the treasure awhile in blissful silence.
“, there’s thousands of dollars ,”  Injun Joe.
“’Twas always   Murrel’s  used to be around  one summer,” the stranger observed.
“I  it,”  Injun Joe; “and  looks  it, I should say.”
“Now you won’t  to do  job.”
The halfbreed frowned.  he:
“You don’t  me. Least you don’t  all about  thing. ’Tain’t robbery altogether—it’s revenge!” and a wicked light flamed in his eyes. “I’ll    in it.  it’s finished— Texas. Go  to  Nance and  , and stand by  you   me.”
“—if you say so; what’ll we do  — it again?”
“Yes. [Ravishing delight overhead.] No! by the great Sachem, no! [Profound distress overhead.] I’d nearly forgot.   had fresh earth on it! [The     terror in a moment.]  business has a  and a shovel ?  business  fresh earth on ? Who brought  —and where are  ?  you heard anybody?— anybody? !  it again and leave  to  and see the ground disturbed? Not exactly—not exactly. We’ll  it to my den.”
“Why, of course! Might  thought of  before. You  Number One?”
“No—Number Two—under the cross. The other place is bad—too common.”
“All right. It’s nearly  enough to start.”
Injun Joe got up and  about  window to window cautiously peeping out. Presently he :
“Who could  brought those tools ? Do you reckon  can be upstairs?”
The boys’ breath forsook . Injun Joe put his  on his knife, halted a moment, undecided, and  turned toward the stairway. The  thought of the closet, but their strength was . The steps  creaking up the stairs—the intolerable distress of the situation  the stricken resolution of the —  about to spring for the closet,  there was a crash of rotten timbers and Injun Joe landed on the ground amid the debris of the ruined stairway. He gathered himself up cursing, and his comrade :
“Now what’s the use of all ? If it’s anybody, and they’re up there, let   there—who cares? If   to  , now, and get into trouble, who objects? It  be  in fifteen minutes—and  let  follow us if   to. I’m willing. In my opinion, whoever  those things in  caught a sight of us and  us for ghosts or devils or something. I’ll bet they’re running yet.”
Joe grumbled awhile;  he agreed  his friend   daylight was  ought to be economized in getting things ready for leaving. Shortly afterward  slipped out of the house in the deepening twilight, and moved toward the river  their precious box.
Tom and   up,  but vastly relieved, and stared after  through the chinks between the  of the house. Follow?

Bitter, bitter   the tools  ever brought there!
 resolved to  a lookout for  Spaniard  he should  to  spying out for chances to do his revengeful job, and follow him to “Number Two,” wherever  might be.  a ghastly thought occurred to Tom.
“Revenge?  if he means us, !”
“Oh, don’t!”  , nearly fainting.
 talked it all over, and as  entered   agreed to believe  he might possibly  somebody else—at least  he might at least  nobody but Tom, since only Tom had testified.
,  small comfort it was to Tom to be alone in danger! Company would be a palpable improvement, he thought.
CHAPTER XXVII
THE adventure of the day mightily tormented Tom’s dreams  night.  times he had his hands on   treasure and  times it wasted to nothingness in his fingers as sleep forsook him and wakefulness brought  the  reality of his misfortune. As he lay in the early morning recalling the incidents of his great adventure, he noticed   seemed curiously subdued and far away—somewhat as if  had happened in another world, or in a    by.  it occurred to him  the great adventure itself  be a dream! There was one  strong argument in favor of  idea—namely,  the quantity of  he had  was too  to be . He had never  as  as fifty dollars in one  before, and he was  all  of his age and station in , in  he imagined  all references to “hundreds” and “thousands”   fanciful forms of speech, and  no   really existed in the world. He never had supposed for a moment  so large a sum as a hundred dollars was to be found in actual money in any one’s possession. If his notions of hidden treasure had  analyzed,  would   found to consist of a handful of  dimes and a bushel of vague, splendid, ungraspable dollars.
But the incidents of his adventure  sensibly sharper and clearer under the attrition of thinking  over, and so he presently found himself leaning to the impression  the thing might not   a dream, after all.  uncertainty  be swept away. He would snatch a hurried breakfast and go and  .  was sitting on the gunwale of a flatboat, listlessly dangling his  in the water and looking  melancholy. Tom concluded to let   up to the subject. If he did not do it,  the adventure would be proved to   only a dream.
“Hello, !”
“Hello, yourself.”
Silence, for a minute.
“Tom, if  ’a’  the blame tools at the  ,  ’a’ got the money. Oh, ain’t it awful!”
“’Tain’t a dream, , ’tain’t a dream! Somehow I   it was. Dog’d if I don’t, .”
“ ain’t a dream?”
“Oh,  thing yesterday. I   thinking it was.”
“Dream! If  stairs hadn’t broke  you’d ’a’  how  dream it was! I’ve had dreams enough all night—  patch-eyed Spanish devil going for me all through ’em—rot him!”
“No, not rot him.  him! Track the money!”
“Tom, we’ll never  him. A feller don’t  only one chance for  a —and  one’s . I’d  mighty shaky if I was to see him, anyway.”
“,  I; but I’d  to see him, anyway—and track him out—to his Number Two.”
“Number Two—yes, that’s it. I  thinking ’bout . But I can’t  nothing out of it.  do you reckon it is?”
“I . It’s too . Say, —maybe it’s the number of a house!”
“Goody!... No, Tom,  ain’t it. If it is, it ain’t in  one-horse .  ain’t no numbers .”
“, that’s so. Lemme think a minute. —it’s the number of a —in a tavern, you !”
“Oh, that’s the trick!  ain’t only two taverns. We can  out quick.”
“You  , ,  I .”
Tom was off at once. He did not  to  Huck’s company in public places. He was   an . He found  in the  tavern, No. 2 had   occupied by a young lawyer, and was still so occupied. In the  ostentatious house, No. 2 was a mystery.

“That’s  I’ve found out, . I reckon that’s the  No. 2 we’re after.”
“I reckon it is, Tom. Now  you going to do?”
“Lemme think.”
Tom thought a  .  he :
“I’ll  you. The   of  No. 2 is the   comes out into  little close alley between the tavern and the old rattle  of a brick store. Now you get  of all the doorkeys you can , and I’ll nip all of auntie’s, and the first  night we’ll go there and try ’em. And  you,  a lookout for Injun Joe, because he  he was going to  into  and spy around once  for a chance to get his revenge. If you see him, you  follow him; and if he don’t go to  No. 2,  ain’t the place.”
“Lordy, I don’t  to foller him by myself!”
“Why, it’ll be night, . He mightn’t ever see you—and if he did, maybe  never think anything.”
“, if it’s pretty  I reckon I’ll track him. I —I . I’ll try.”
“You bet I’ll follow him, if it’s , . Why, he might ’a’ found out he couldn’t get his revenge, and be going right after  money.”
“It’s so, Tom, it’s so. I’ll foller him; I , by jingoes!”
“Now you’re talking! Don’t you ever weaken, , and I won’t.”
CHAPTER XXVIII
 night Tom and   ready for their adventure.   about the neighborhood of the tavern until after , one watching the alley at a distance and the other the tavern . Nobody entered the alley or  it; nobody resembling the Spaniard entered or  the tavern . The night promised to be a  one; so Tom    the understanding  if a considerable degree of darkness  on,  was to  and “,” whereupon he would  out and try the . But the night remained clear, and  closed his watch and retired to bed in an empty sugar hogshead about twelve.
Tuesday the  had the  ill . Also Wednesday. But Thursday night promised better. Tom slipped out in  season  his aunt’s old tin lantern, and a large towel to blindfold it . He hid the lantern in Huck’s sugar hogshead and the watch began. An  before midnight the tavern closed up and its lights (the only ones thereabouts)  put out. No Spaniard had  . Nobody had entered or  the alley. Everything was auspicious. The blackness of darkness reigned, the perfect stillness was interrupted only by occasional mutterings of distant thunder.
Tom got his lantern, lit it in the hogshead, wrapped it closely in the towel, and the two adventurers crept in the gloom toward the tavern.  stood sentry and Tom  his way into the alley.  there was a season of waiting anxiety  weighed upon Huck’s spirits  a mountain. He began to  he could see a flash  the lantern—it would frighten him, but it would at least  him  Tom was alive yet. It seemed hours since Tom had disappeared. Surely he   fainted; maybe he was ; maybe his heart had burst under terror and excitement. In his uneasiness  found himself drawing closer and closer to the alley; fearing all sorts of dreadful things, and momentarily expecting  catastrophe to happen  would  away his breath. There was not  to  away, for he seemed only able to inhale it by thimblefuls, and his heart would   itself out, the way it was beating. Suddenly there was a flash of light and Tom  tearing by him: “Run!”  he; “run, for  !”
He needn’t  repeated it; once was enough;  was making thirty or forty miles an  before the repetition was uttered. The  never stopped   reached the  of a deserted slaughter-house at the lower end of the village.  as  got within its shelter the storm burst and the  poured . As  as Tom got his breath he :
“, it was awful! I tried two of the ,  as  as I could; but  seemed to   a power of racket  I couldn’t hardly get my breath I was so scared.  wouldn’t  in the , either. , without noticing  I was doing, I   of the , and open comes the ! It warn’t locked! I hopped in, and shook off the towel, and, Great Caesar’s Ghost!”
“!—what’d you see, Tom?”
“, I  stepped onto Injun Joe’s !”
“No!”
“Yes! He was lying there, sound asleep on the floor,  his old patch on his eye and his arms spread out.”
“Lordy,  did you do? Did he  up?”
“No, never budged. Drunk, I reckon. I  grabbed  towel and started!”
“I’d never ’a’ thought of the towel, I bet!”
“, I would. My aunt would  me mighty  if I  it.”
“Say, Tom, did you see  box?”
“, I didn’t  to  around. I didn’t see the box, I didn’t see the cross. I didn’t see anything but a bottle and a tin cup on the floor by Injun Joe; yes, I saw two barrels and   bottles in the . Don’t you see, now, what’s the matter   ha’nted ?”
“How?”
“Why, it’s ha’nted  whiskey! Maybe all the Temperance Taverns  got a ha’nted , hey, ?”
“, I reckon maybe that’s so. Who’d ’a’ thought  a thing? But say, Tom, now’s a mighty   to get  box, if Injun Joe’s drunk.”
“It is, ! You try it!”
 shuddered.
“, no—I reckon not.”
“And I reckon not, . Only one bottle alongside of Injun Joe ain’t enough. If there’d  three,  be drunk enough and I’d do it.”
There was a  pause for reflection, and  Tom :
“Lookyhere, ,  not try  thing any   we  Injun Joe’s not in there. It’s too scary. Now, if we watch every night, we’ll be   to see him go out,   or other, and  we’ll snatch  box quicker’n lightning.”
“, I’m agreed. I’ll watch the whole night , and I’ll do it every night, too, if you’ll do the other  of the job.”
“All right, I . All you got to do is to  up Hooper Street a block and —and if I’m asleep, you throw  gravel at the window and that’ll fetch me.”
“Agreed, and  as wheat!”
“Now, , the storm’s over, and I’ll go . It’ll begin to be daylight in a couple of hours. You go  and watch  ,  you?”
“I  I would, Tom, and I . I’ll ha’nt  tavern every night for a ! I’ll sleep all day and I’ll stand watch all night.”
“That’s all right. Now, where you going to sleep?”
“In Ben Rogers’ hayloft. He  me, and so  his pap’s nigger man, Uncle . I  water for Uncle  whenever he wants me to, and any  I ask him he gives me a little something to eat if he can spare it. That’s a mighty  nigger, Tom. He likes me, becuz I don’t ever act as if I was above him. Sometime I’ve set right  and eat  him. But you needn’t  . A body’s got to do things   awful hungry he wouldn’t  to do as a steady thing.”
“, if I don’t  you in the daytime, I’ll let you sleep. I won’t  bothering around. Any  you see something’s up, in the night,   right around and .”
CHAPTER 
THE first thing Tom heard on Friday morning was a  piece of —Judge Thatcher’s family had   to  the night before.  Injun Joe and the treasure  into secondary importance for a moment, and Becky  the chief place in the boy’s interest. He saw her and  had an exhausting   playing “hispy” and “gully-keeper”  a crowd of their schoolmates. The day was completed and crowned in a peculiarly satisfactory way: Becky teased her mother to appoint the  day for the -promised and -delayed picnic, and she consented. The child’s delight was boundless; and Tom’s not  moderate. The invitations   out before sunset, and straightway the young folks of the village  thrown into a fever of preparation and pleasurable anticipation. Tom’s excitement enabled him to  awake until a pretty  , and he had  hopes of hearing Huck’s “,” and of having his treasure to astonish Becky and the picnickers ,  day; but he was disappointed. No signal   night.
Morning , eventually, and by ten or eleven o’clock a giddy and rollicking company  gathered at Judge Thatcher’s, and everything was ready for a start. It was not the custom for elderly people to mar the picnics  their presence. The children  considered  enough under the wings of a few young ladies of eighteen and a few young gentlemen of twenty-three or thereabouts. The old steam ferry- was chartered for the occasion; presently the gay throng filed up the  street laden  provision-baskets. Sid was  and had to  the fun;  remained at  to entertain him. The  thing Mrs. Thatcher  to Becky, was:
“You’ll not get   . Perhaps you’d better  all night   of the girls    the ferry-landing, child.”
“ I’ll    Harper, mamma.”
“ . And  and behave yourself and don’t be any trouble.”
Presently, as  tripped along, Tom  to Becky:
“Say—I’ll  you  we’ll do. ’Stead of going to Joe Harper’s we’ll climb right up the  and  at the Widow Douglas’. She’ll  ice-cream! She has it  every day— loads of it. And she’ll be awful  to  us.”
“Oh,   be fun!”
 Becky reflected a moment and :
“But   mamma say?”
“How’ll she ever ?”
The  turned the idea over in her , and  reluctantly:
“I reckon it’s wrong—but—”
“But shucks!  mother won’t , and so what’s the ? All she wants is  you’ll be ; and I bet you she’d ’a’  go there if she’d ’a’ thought of it. I  she would!”
The Widow Douglas’ splendid hospitality was a tempting . It and Tom’s persuasions presently carried the day. So it was decided to say nothing to anybody about the night’s programme. Presently it occurred to Tom  maybe  might    night and  the signal. The thought  a  of the spirit out of his anticipations. Still he could not  to  up the fun at Widow Douglas’. And why should he  it up, he reasoned—the signal did not  the night before, so why should it be any  likely to  tonight? The  fun of the evening outweighed the uncertain treasure; and, boy-, he determined to yield to the stronger inclination and not allow himself to think of the box of money another   day.
Three miles below  the ferryboat stopped at the mouth of a woody hollow and  up. The crowd swarmed ashore and  the forest distances and craggy heights echoed far and   shoutings and laughter. All the different  of getting hot and tired   through , and by-and-by the rovers straggled  to  fortified  responsible appetites, and  the destruction of the  things began. After the feast there was a refreshing season of  and  in the shade of spreading oaks. By-and-by somebody shouted:
“Who’s ready for the ?”
Everybody was. Bundles of candles  procured, and straightway there was a general scamper up the . The mouth of the  was up the hillside—an opening shaped  a letter A. Its massive oaken  stood unbarred. Within was a small chamber, chilly as an icehouse, and walled by Nature  solid limestone  was   a  sweat. It was romantic and mysterious to stand  in the  gloom and  out upon the green valley shining in the sun. But the impressiveness of the situation quickly  off, and the romping began again. The moment a candle was lighted there was a general  upon the owner of it; a struggle and a gallant defence followed, but the candle was  knocked  or blown out, and  there was a  clamor of laughter and a new chase. But all things  an end. By-and-by the procession  filing  the steep descent of the  avenue, the flickering  of lights dimly revealing the lofty walls of  almost to their point of junction sixty  overhead.   avenue was not   eight or ten  . Every few steps other lofty and still narrower crevices branched  it on either —for McDougal’s  was but a  labyrinth of crooked aisles  ran into each other and out again and led nowhere. It was   one might wander  and nights together through its intricate tangle of rifts and chasms, and never  the end of the ; and  he might go , and , and still , into the earth, and it was  the —labyrinth under labyrinth, and no end to any of .

The procession moved along the  avenue  three-quarters of a , and  groups and couples began to  aside into branch avenues, fly along the dismal corridors, and  each other by surprise at points where the corridors joined again. Parties  able to elude each other for the space of  an  without going beyond the “known” ground.
By-and-by, one group after another  straggling  to the mouth of the , panting, hilarious, smeared   to   tallow drippings, daubed  , and entirely delighted  the success of the day.    astonished to    had  taking no  of  and  night was about at .

 was already upon his watch  the ferryboat’s lights  glinting  the wharf. He heard no noise on board, for the young people  as subdued and still as people usually are who are nearly tired to death. He wondered   it was, and why she did not  at the wharf—and  he dropped her out of his  and put his attention upon his business. The night was growing cloudy and . Ten o’clock , and the noise of vehicles ceased, scattered lights began to  out, all straggling -passengers disappeared, the village betook itself to its slumbers and  the small watcher alone  the silence and the ghosts. Eleven o’clock , and the tavern lights  put out; darkness everywhere, now.  waited  seemed a weary  , but nothing happened. His faith was weakening. Was there any use? Was there really any use? Why not  it up and  in?
A noise  upon his ear. He was all attention in an instant. The alley  closed softly. He sprang to the corner of the brick store. The  moment two men brushed by him, and one seemed to  something under his arm. It  be  box! So   going to remove the treasure. Why  Tom now? It would be absurd—the men would get away  the box and never be found again. No, he would stick to their  and follow ; he would trust to the darkness for security  discovery. So communing  himself,  stepped out and glided along behind the men, cat-,   , allowing  to   far enough ahead not to be invisible.

He trotted along awhile;  slackened his , fearing he was gaining too ; moved on a piece,  stopped altogether; listened; no sound; ,   he seemed to  the beating of his own heart. The hooting of an owl  over the —ominous sound! But no footsteps. Heavens, was everything ! He was about to spring  winged ,  a man cleared his throat not    him! Huck’s heart  into his throat, but he swallowed it again; and  he stood there shaking as if a dozen agues had taken charge of him at once, and so   he thought he  surely  to the ground. He  where he was. He  he was within  steps of the stile leading into Widow Douglas’ grounds.  , he thought, let   it there; it won’t be  to .
Now there was a voice—a  low voice—Injun Joe’s:
“ her, maybe she’s got company—there’s lights,  as it is.”
“I can’t see any.”
 was  stranger’s voice—the stranger of the haunted house. A deadly chill  to Huck’s heart—, , was the “revenge” job! His thought was, to fly.  he remembered  the Widow Douglas had   to him   once, and maybe these men  going to murder her. He wished he dared venture to  her; but he  he didn’t — might  and catch him. He thought all  and  in the moment  elapsed between the stranger’s remark and Injun Joe’s —which was—
“Because the  is in  way. Now— way—now you see, don’t you?”
“Yes. , there is company there, I reckon. Better  it up.”
“ it up, and I  leaving  country forever!  it up and maybe never  another chance. I  you again, as I’ve  you before, I don’t  for her —you may  it.

“Oh, don’t  her! Don’t do !”
“? Who  anything about killing? I would  him if he was ; but not her.  you  to get revenge on a woman you don’t  her—! you go for her looks. You  her nostrils—you notch her ears  a sow!”
“By God, that’s—”

“Do it now? And company there?  —I’ll get suspicious of you, first thing you . No—we’ll   the lights are out—there’s no hurry.”
   a silence was going to ensue—a thing still  awful  any amount of murderous ; so he  his breath and stepped gingerly ; planted his  carefully and firmly, after balancing, one-legged, in a precarious way and almost toppling over, first on one  and  on the other. He  another  ,  the  elaboration and the  risks;  another and another, and—a  snapped under his ! His breath stopped and he listened. There was no sound—the stillness was perfect. His gratitude was measureless. Now he turned in his tracks, between the walls of sumach bushes—turned himself as carefully as if he  a —and  stepped quickly but cautiously along.  he emerged at the quarry he  secure, and so he picked up his nimble heels and . ,  he ,  he reached the Welshman’s. He banged at the , and presently the heads of the old man and his two stalwart   thrust  windows.
“What’s the row there? Who’s banging?  do you ?”
“Let me in—quick! I’ll  everything.”
“Why, who are you?”
“Huckleberry —quick, let me in!”
“Huckleberry , indeed! It ain’t a  to open  doors, I judge! But let him in, , and let’s see what’s the trouble.”
“Please don’t ever  I  you,”  Huck’s first words  he got in. “Please don’t—I’d be killed, —but the widow’s   friends to me sometimes, and I  to —I   if you’ll promise you won’t ever say it was me.”
“By George, he has got something to , or he wouldn’t act so!” exclaimed the old man; “out  it and nobody here’ll ever , lad.”
Three minutes later the old man and his ,  armed,  up the , and  entering the sumach  on tiptoe, their weapons in their hands.  accompanied  no further.

AS the earliest suspicion of  appeared on Sunday morning,   groping up the  and rapped gently at the old Welshman’s . The inmates  asleep, but it was a sleep  was set on a -trigger, on account of the exciting episode of the night. A    a window:
“Who’s there!”
Huck’s scared voice answered in a low :
“Please let me in! It’s only  !”
“It’s a   can open   night or day, lad!—and welcome!”
These  strange words to the vagabond boy’s ears, and the pleasantest he had ever heard. He could not recollect  the closing  had ever  applied in his  before. The  was quickly unlocked, and he entered.  was given a  and the old man and his brace of   speedily dressed themselves.
“Now, my boy, I  you’re  and hungry, because breakfast  be ready as  as the sun’s up, and we’ll  a piping hot one, too— yourself easy about ! I and the  hoped you’d  up and    night.”
“I was awful scared,”  , “and I run. I  out  the pistols  off, and I didn’t  for three . I’ve  now becuz I wanted to  about it, you ; and I  before daylight becuz I didn’t  to run across  devils, even if  was .”

You see we  right where to put our hands on , by  description; so we crept along on tiptoe  we got within fifteen  of — as a cellar  sumach  was—and   I found I was going to sneeze.

As  as we  the sound of their  we  chasing, and   and stirred up the constables.  got a posse together, and  off to guard the river , and as  as it is light the sheriff and a  are going to  up the woods.

“Oh yes; I saw  downtown and follered .”
“Splendid! Describe —describe , my boy!”
“One’s the old  and  Spaniard that’s ben around  once or twice, and t’other’s a -looking, ragged—”
“That’s enough, lad, we  the men! Happened on  in the woods  of the widow’s one day, and  slunk away. Off  you, , and  the sheriff—get  breakfast tomorrow morning!”
The Welshman’s  departed at once. As   leaving the   sprang up and exclaimed:
“Oh, please don’t  anybody it was me  blowed on ! Oh, please!”
“All right if you say it, , but you ought to  the credit of  you did.”
“Oh no, no! Please don’t !”

The old man promised secrecy once , and :
“How did you  to follow these fellows, lad?   looking suspicious?”
 was silent while he framed a  cautious reply.  he :

I couldn’t sleep, and so I  along upstreet ’bout midnight, a-turning it all over, and  I got to  old shackly brick store by the Temperance Tavern, I backed up agin the  to  another think. ,   along comes these two chaps slipping along close by me,  something under their arm, and I reckoned they’d stole it. One was a-smoking, and t’other one wanted a light; so  stopped right before me and the cigars lit up their faces and I see  the big one was the  and  Spaniard, by his white whiskers and the patch on his eye, and t’other one was a rusty, ragged-looking devil.”
“Could you see the  by the light of the cigars?”
 staggered  for a moment.  he :
“, I don’t —but somehow it seems as if I did.”
“   on, and you—”
“Follered ’em—yes.  was it. I wanted to see  was up— sneaked along so. I dogged ’em to the widder’s stile, and stood in the  and heard the ragged one beg for the widder, and the Spaniard swear  spile her looks  as I  you and  two—”
“! The  and  man  all !”
 had  another terrible mistake! He was trying his  to  the old man  getting the faintest  of who the Spaniard might be, and yet his tongue seemed determined to get him into trouble in spite of all he could do. He  several efforts to creep out of his scrape, but the old man’s eye was upon him and he  blunder after blunder. Presently the Welshman :
“My boy, don’t be afraid of me. I wouldn’t  a  of   for all the world. No—I’d protect you—I’d protect you.  Spaniard is not  and ; you’ve let   without intending it; you can’t cover  up now. You  something about  Spaniard  you  to  . Now trust me— me  it is, and trust me—I won’t betray you.”
 looked into the old man’s honest eyes a moment,   over and whispered in his ear:
“’Tain’t a Spaniard—it’s Injun Joe!”
The Welshman almost jumped out of his chair. In a moment he :
“It’s all plain enough, now.  you talked about notching ears and slitting noses I judged   was  own embellishment, because white men don’t    of revenge. But an Injun! That’s a different matter altogether.”
During breakfast the   on, and in the course of it the old man   the  thing which he and his  had , before going to bed, was to get a lantern and examine the stile and its vicinity for marks of blood.  found , but captured a bulky bundle of—
“Of ?”
If the words had  lightning  could not  leaped  a  stunning suddenness  Huck’s blanched . His eyes  staring , now, and his breath suspended—waiting for the answer. The Welshman started—stared in return—three seconds— seconds—ten— replied:
“Of burglar’s tools. Why, what’s the matter  you?”
  , panting gently, but deeply, unutterably grateful. The Welshman eyed him gravely, curiously—and presently :
“Yes, burglar’s tools.  appears to relieve you a  . But  did  you  ?   you expecting  found?”
 was in a close place—the inquiring eye was upon him—he would  given anything for material for a plausible answer—nothing suggested itself—the inquiring eye was boring deeper and deeper—a senseless reply offered—there was no  to weigh it, so at a venture he uttered it—feebly:
“Sunday-school books, maybe.”
  was too distressed to smile, but the old man laughed  and joyously, shook up the details of his anatomy   to , and ended by saying   a laugh was money in a-man’s pocket, because it cut  the doctor’s   everything.  he added:
“ old , you’re white and jaded—you ain’t  a bit—no wonder you’re a little flighty and off  balance. But you’ll  out of it.  and sleep  fetch you out all right, I .”
 was irritated to think he had   a goose and betrayed  a suspicious excitement, for he had dropped the idea  the parcel brought  the tavern was the treasure, as  as he had heard the  at the widow’s stile. He had only thought it was not the treasure, however—he had not known  it wasn’t—and so the suggestion of a captured bundle was too  for his -possession. But on the whole he   the little episode had happened, for now he  beyond all question   bundle was not the bundle, and so his  was at  and exceedingly comfortable. In , everything seemed to be drifting  in the right direction, now; the treasure  be still in No. 2, the men would be captured and jailed  day, and he and Tom could seize the   night without any trouble or any  of interruption.
 as breakfast was completed there was a knock at the .  jumped for a hiding-place, for he had no  to be connected even remotely  the  event. The Welshman admitted several ladies and gentlemen, among  the Widow Douglas, and noticed  groups of citizens  climbing up the —to stare at the stile. So the  had spread. The Welshman had to  the story of the night to the visitors. The widow’s gratitude for her preservation was outspoken.

“We judged it warn’t worth while. Those fellows warn’t likely to  again— hadn’t any tools  to  , and  was the use of waking you up and scaring you to death? My three negro men stood guard at  house all the  of the night. They’ve   .”
 visitors , and the story had to be  and retold for a couple of hours .
There was no Sabbath-school during day-school vacation, but everybody was early at church. The stirring event was  canvassed.    not a  of the two villains had  yet discovered.  the sermon was finished, Judge Thatcher’s  dropped alongside of Mrs. Harper as she moved  the aisle  the crowd and :
“Is my Becky going to sleep all day? I  expected she would be tired to death.”
“ Becky?”
“Yes,”  a startled —“didn’t she   you  night?”
“Why, no.”
Mrs. Thatcher turned , and  into a pew,  as Aunt Polly, talking briskly  a friend, passed by. Aunt Polly :
“Goodmorning, Mrs. Thatcher. Goodmorning, Mrs. Harper. I’ve got a boy that’s turned up missing. I reckon my Tom stayed at  house  night—one of you. And now  afraid to  to church. I’ve got to settle  him.”
Mrs. Thatcher shook her  feebly and turned paler  ever.
“He didn’t   us,”  Mrs. Harper, beginning to  uneasy. A marked anxiety  into Aunt Polly’s .
“Joe Harper,  you  my Tom  morning?”
“.”
“ did you see him ?”
Joe tried to remember, but was not  he could say. The people had stopped moving out of church. Whispers passed along, and a boding uneasiness  possession of every countenance. Children  anxiously questioned, and young teachers.  all   had not noticed whether Tom and Becky  on board the ferryboat on the homeward ; it was ; no one thought of inquiring if any one was missing. One young man finally blurted out his     still in the ! Mrs. Thatcher swooned away. Aunt Polly  to crying and wringing her hands.
The alarm swept  lip to lip,  group to group,  street to street, and within  minutes the bells  wildly clanging and the whole  was up! The Cardiff  episode  into instant insignificance, the burglars  forgotten, horses  saddled, skiffs  manned, the ferryboat ordered out, and before the horror was  an  old, two hundred men  pouring  highroad and river toward the .
All the  afternoon the village seemed empty and .  women visited Aunt Polly and Mrs. Thatcher and tried to comfort .  cried  , too, and  was still better  words.

The Welshman   had  spots in him, and the widow :
“You can depend on it. That’s the Lord’s . He don’t leave it off. He never .  it somewhere on every creature  comes  his hands.”
Early in the forenoon parties of jaded men began to straggle into the village, but the strongest of the citizens continued searching. All the   could be gained was  remotenesses of the cavern  being ransacked  had never  visited before;  every corner and crevice was going to be thoroughly searched;  wherever one wandered through the  of passages, lights  to be  flitting hither and thither in the distance, and shoutings and pistol-shots  their hollow reverberations to the ear  the sombre aisles. In one place, far  the section usually traversed by tourists, the names “BECKY & TOM” had  found traced upon the rocky   candle-smoke, and  at  a grease-soiled bit of ribbon. Mrs. Thatcher recognized the ribbon and cried over it. She  it was the  relic she should ever  of her child; and  no other memorial of her could ever be so precious, because  one parted latest  the living  before the awful death .    now and , in the , a far-away speck of light would glimmer, and  a glorious shout would burst forth and a score of men go trooping  the echoing aisle—and  a sickening disappointment always followed; the children  not there; it was only a searcher’s light.
Three dreadful  and nights dragged their tedious hours along, and the village  into a hopeless stupor. No one had heart for anything. The accidental discovery,  ,  the proprietor of the Temperance Tavern  liquor on his premises, scarcely fluttered the public pulse, tremendous as the  was. In a lucid interval,  feebly led up to the subject of taverns, and finally asked—dimly dreading the worst—if anything had  discovered at the Temperance Tavern since he had  ill.
“Yes,”  the widow.

“?  was it?”
“Liquor!—and the place has   up. Lie , child— a  you did  me!”
“Only  me  one thing—only  one—please! Was it Tom Sawyer  found it?”
The widow burst into tears. “, , child, ! I’ve  you before, you  not . You are ,  !”
 nothing but liquor had  found; there would   a great powwow if it had  the . So the treasure was  forever— forever! But  could she be crying about? Curious  she should cry.
These thoughts worked their dim way through Huck’s , and under the weariness   him he  asleep. The widow  to herself:
“There— asleep,  wreck. Tom Sawyer  it!  but somebody could  Tom Sawyer! Ah, there ain’t  , now, that’s got  enough, or strength enough, either, to go on searching.”
CHAPTER 
NOW to return to Tom and Becky’s share in the picnic.  tripped along the murky aisles  the  of the company, visiting the familiar wonders of the —wonders dubbed  rather over-descriptive names,  as “The Drawing-,” “The Cathedral,” “Aladdin’s Palace,” and so on. Presently the -and- frolicking began, and Tom and Becky engaged in it   until the exertion began to  a trifle wearisome;   wandered  a sinuous avenue holding their candles aloft and reading the tangled webwork of names, dates, postoffice addresses, and mottoes  which the rocky walls had  frescoed (in candle-smoke). Still drifting along and talking,  scarcely noticed    now in a  of the  whose walls  not frescoed.  smoked their own names under an overhanging shelf and moved on. Presently   to a place where a little stream of water, trickling over a ledge and carrying a limestone sediment  it, had, in the -dragging ages, formed a laced and ruffled Niagara in gleaming and imperishable stone. Tom squeezed his small  behind it in order to illuminate it for Becky’s gratification. He found  it curtained a  of steep natural stairway which was enclosed between narrow walls, and at once the ambition to be a discoverer seized him.

In one place  found a spacious cavern,  whose ceiling depended a multitude of shining stalactites of the length and circumference of a man’s leg;  walked all about it, wondering and admiring, and presently  it by one of the numerous passages  opened into it.  shortly brought  to a bewitching spring, whose basin was incrusted  a frostwork of glittering crystals; it was in the midst of a cavern whose walls  supported by  fantastic pillars which had  formed by the joining of great stalactites and stalagmites together, the result of the ceaseless water- of centuries. Under the   knots of  had packed themselves together, thousands in a bunch; the lights disturbed the creatures and   flocking  by hundreds, squeaking and darting furiously at the candles.

He seized Becky’s  and hurried her into the first corridor  offered; and  too , for a bat struck Becky’s light out  its  while she was passing out of the cavern. The  chased the children a  distance; but the fugitives plunged into every new passage  offered, and at  got rid of the perilous things. Tom found a subterranean , shortly, which stretched its dim length away until its shape was  in the shadows. He wanted to explore its borders, but concluded  it would be  to sit  and  awhile, first. Now, for the first , the  stillness of the place  a clammy  upon the spirits of the children. Becky :
“Why, I didn’t notice, but it seems ever so  since I heard any of the others.”
“ to think, Becky, we are away  below —and I don’t  how far away north, or south, or east, or whichever it is. We couldn’t   .”
Becky  apprehensive.
“I wonder how  we’ve   , Tom? We better start .”
“Yes, I reckon we better. P’raps we better.”
“Can you  the way, Tom? It’s all a mixed-up crookedness to me.”
“I reckon I could  it—but  the . If  put our candles out it  be an awful fix. Let’s try  other way, so as not to go through there.”

 started through a corridor, and traversed it in silence a  way, glancing at each new opening, to see if there was anything familiar about the  of it; but   all strange. Every  Tom  an examination, Becky would watch his  for an encouraging , and he would say cheerily:
“Oh, it’s all right.  ain’t the one, but we’ll  to it right away!”
But he   and  hopeful  each failure, and presently began to  off into diverging avenues at sheer random, in desperate  of finding the one  was wanted. He still  it was “all right,” but there was  a leaden dread at his heart  the words had  their  and sounded  as if he had , “All is !” Becky clung to his  in an anguish of , and tried  to   the tears, but  would . At  she :
“Oh, Tom, never  the , let’s go   way! We  to get worse and worse off all the .”
“Listen!”  he.
Profound silence; silence so   even their breathings  conspicuous in the . Tom shouted. The   echoing  the empty aisles and  out in the distance in a faint sound  resembled a ripple of mocking laughter.
“Oh, don’t do it again, Tom, it is too horrid,”  Becky.
“It is horrid, but I better, Becky;  might  us, you ,” and he shouted again.
The “might” was even a chillier horror  the ghostly laughter, it so confessed a perishing . The children stood still and listened; but there was no result. Tom turned upon the  track at once, and hurried his steps. It was but a little while before a certain indecision in his manner revealed another fearful  to Becky—he could not  his way !
“Oh, Tom, you didn’t  any marks!”
“Becky, I was  a !  a ! I never thought we might  to  ! No—I can’t  the way. It’s all mixed up.”
“Tom, Tom, we’re ! we’re ! We never can get out of  awful place! Oh, why did we ever leave the others!”
She  to the ground and burst into  a frenzy of crying  Tom was appalled  the idea  she might die, or  her reason. He sat  by her and put his arms around her; she buried her  in his bosom, she clung to him, she poured out her terrors, her unavailing regrets, and the far echoes turned  all to jeering laughter. Tom begged her to pluck up  again, and she  she could not. He  to blaming and abusing himself for getting her into  miserable situation;  had a better effect. She  she would try to  again, she would get up and follow wherever he might  if only he would not    any . For he was no  to blame  she, she .
So  moved on again—aimlessly—simply at random—all  could do was to ,  moving. For a little while,   a  of reviving—not  any reason to  it, but only because it is its nature to revive  the spring has not  taken out of it by age and familiarity  failure.
By-and-by Tom  Becky’s candle and  it out.  economy meant so ! Words  not needed. Becky understood, and her   again. She   Tom had a whole candle and three or  pieces in his pockets—yet he  economize.
By-and-by, fatigue began to assert its claims; the children tried to pay attention, for it was dreadful to think of sitting    was grown to be so precious, moving, in  direction, in any direction, was at least progress and might  fruit; but to sit  was to invite death and shorten its pursuit.
At  Becky’s frail limbs refused to carry her farther. She sat . Tom rested  her, and  talked of , and the friends there, and the comfortable  and, above all, the light! Becky cried, and Tom tried to think of  way of comforting her, but all his encouragements  grown thread-  use, and sounded  sarcasms. Fatigue  so heavily upon Becky  she drowsed off to sleep. Tom was grateful. He sat looking into her drawn  and saw it  smooth and natural under the influence of pleasant dreams; and by-and-by a smile dawned and rested there. The peaceful  reflected somewhat of peace and healing into his own spirit, and his thoughts wandered away to bygone times and dreamy memories. While he was  in his musings, Becky  up  a breezy little laugh—but it was stricken  upon her , and a groan followed it.
“Oh, how could I sleep! I  I never, never had waked! No! No, I don’t, Tom! Don’t  so! I won’t say it again.”
“I’m  you’ve slept, Becky; you’ll  rested, now, and we’ll  the way out.”
“We can try, Tom; but I’ve   a beautiful country in my dream. I reckon we are going there.”
“Maybe not, maybe not. Cheer up, Becky, and let’s go on trying.”

“Do you remember ?”  he.
Becky almost smiled.
“It’s our wedding-, Tom.”
“Yes—I  it was as big as a barrel, for it’s all we’ve got.”
“I saved it  the picnic for us to dream on, Tom, the way grownup people do  wedding-—but it’ll be our—”
She dropped the sentence where it was. Tom divided the  and Becky ate   appetite, while Tom nibbled at his moiety. There was abundance of  water to finish the feast . By-and-by Becky suggested    on again. Tom was silent a moment.  he :
“Becky, can you  it if I  you something?”
Becky’s  paled, but she thought she could.

“They’ll  us and  for us!”
“Yes,  ! Certainly  !”
“Maybe they’re hunting for us now, Tom.”
“Why, I reckon maybe  are. I   are.”
“ would   us, Tom?”
“  get  to the , I reckon.”
“Tom, it might be  —would  notice we hadn’t ?”
“I don’t . But anyway,  mother would  you as  as  got .”
A frightened  in Becky’s  brought Tom to his senses and he saw  he had  a blunder. Becky was not to     night! The children became silent and thoughtful. In a moment a new burst of grief  Becky showed Tom  the thing in his  had struck  also— the Sabbath morning might be  spent before Mrs. Thatcher discovered  Becky was not at Mrs. Harper’s.
The children fastened their eyes upon their bit of candle and watched it  slowly and pitilessly away; saw the  inch of  stand alone at ; saw the feeble flame  and , climb the  column of smoke, linger at its top a moment, and —the horror of utter darkness reigned!
How  afterward it was  Becky  to a  consciousness  she was crying in Tom’s arms, neither could .

He tried it; but in the darkness the distant echoes sounded so hideously  he tried it no .
The hours wasted away, and hunger  to torment the captives again. A portion of Tom’s  of the  was ;  divided and ate it. But  seemed hungrier  before. The  morsel of  only whetted desire.
By-and-by Tom :
“SH! Did you  ?”

“It’s !”  Tom; “they’re coming!  along, Becky—we’re all right now!”
The joy of the prisoners was almost overwhelming. Their speed was , however, because pitfalls  somewhat common, and had to be guarded against.  shortly  to one and had to . It might be three  , it might be a hundred—there was no passing it at any . Tom got  on his breast and reached as far  as he could. No bottom.    there and  until the searchers .  listened; evidently the distant shoutings  growing  distant! a moment or two  and  had  altogether. The heart-sinking misery of it! Tom whooped until he was hoarse, but it was of no use. He talked hopefully to Becky; but an age of anxious waiting passed and no sounds  again.
The children groped their way  to the spring. The weary  dragged on;  slept again, and awoke famished and woe-stricken. Tom believed it  be Tuesday by  .
Now an idea struck him. There    passages  at . It would be better to explore  of these   the weight of the heavy  in idleness. He  a -  his pocket,  it to a projection, and he and Becky started, Tom in the , unwinding the  as he groped along. At the end of twenty steps the corridor ended in a “jumping-off place.” Tom got  on his knees and  below, and  as far around the corner as he could reach  his hands conveniently; he  an effort to stretch yet a little farther to the right, and at  moment, not twenty yards away, a human , holding a candle, appeared  behind a ! Tom lifted up a glorious shout, and instantly   was followed by the  it belonged to—Injun Joe’s! Tom was paralyzed; he could not . He was vastly gratified the  moment, to see the “Spaniard”  to his heels and get himself out of sight. Tom wondered  Joe had not recognized his voice and  over and killed him for testifying in court.

He  her he had only shouted “for .”
But hunger and wretchedness  superior to fears in the  run. Another tedious  at the spring and another  sleep brought changes. The children awoke tortured  a raging hunger. Tom believed  it  be Wednesday or Thursday or even Friday or Saturday, now, and  the search had  given over. He proposed to explore another passage. He  willing to  Injun Joe and all other terrors.

CHAPTER XXXII
TUESDAY afternoon , and waned to the twilight. The village of St. Petersburg still mourned. The  children had not  found. Public prayers had  offered up for , and  and  a private prayer  had the petitioner’s whole heart in it; but still no     the . The majority of the searchers had given up the quest and   to their daily avocations, saying  it was plain the children could never be found. Mrs. Thatcher was  ill, and a great  of the  delirious. People  it was heartbreaking to  her  her child, and raise her  and listen a whole minute at a ,  lay it wearily  again  a . Aunt Polly had drooped into a settled melancholy, and her   had grown almost white. The village  to its  on Tuesday night, sad and forlorn.
Away in the middle of the night a   burst  the village bells, and in a moment the streets  swarming  frantic - people, who shouted, “ out!  out! they’re found! they’re found!” Tin  and horns  added to the din, the population massed itself and moved toward the river, met the children coming in an open carriage drawn by shouting citizens, thronged around it, joined its homeward march, and swept magnificently up the  street roaring huzzah after huzzah!
The village was illuminated; nobody  to bed again; it was the greatest night the little  had ever . During the first - a procession of villagers filed through Judge Thatcher’s house, seized the saved ones and kissed , squeezed Mrs. Thatcher’s , tried to speak but couldn’t—and drifted out raining tears all over the place.
Aunt Polly’s happiness was complete, and Mrs. Thatcher’s nearly so. It would be complete, however, as  as the messenger dispatched  the great  to the  should get the  to her husband. Tom lay upon a   an eager auditory about him and  the history of the wonderful adventure, putting in  striking additions to adorn it withal; and closed  a description of how he  Becky and  on an exploring expedition; how he followed two avenues as far as his - would reach; how he followed a third to the fullest stretch of the -, and was about to    he glimpsed a far-off speck  looked  daylight; dropped the  and groped toward it, pushed his  and shoulders through a small , and saw the broad Mississippi rolling by!
And if it had only happened to be night he would not    speck of daylight and would not  explored  passage any !

He described how he labored  her and convinced her; and how she almost  for joy  she had groped to where she actually saw the  speck of daylight; how he pushed his way out at the  and  helped her out; how  sat there and cried for gladness; how  men  along in a skiff and Tom hailed  and   their situation and their famished condition; how the men didn’t believe the   at first, “because,”  , “you are  miles  the river below the valley the  is in”—   aboard, rowed to a house,   supper,     two or three hours after  and  brought  .
Before day-, Judge Thatcher and the handful of searchers  him  tracked out, in the , by the twine clews  had strung behind , and informed of the great .

Tom learned of Huck’s sickness and  to see him on Friday, but could not be admitted to the bedroom; neither could he on Saturday or Sunday. He was admitted daily after , but was warned to  still about his adventure and introduce no exciting topic. The Widow Douglas stayed by to see  he obeyed. At  Tom learned of the Cardiff  event; also  the “ragged man’s”  had eventually  found in the river  the ferry-landing; he had  drowned while trying to escape, perhaps.
About a fortnight after Tom’s rescue  the , he started off to visit , who had grown plenty strong enough, now, to  exciting , and Tom had   would interest him, he thought. Judge Thatcher’s house was on Tom’s way, and he stopped to see Becky. The Judge and  friends set Tom to talking, and  one asked him ironically if he wouldn’t  to go to the  again. Tom  he thought he wouldn’t  it. The Judge :
“, there are others   you, Tom, I’ve not the least doubt. But we  taken  of . Nobody  get  in   any .”
“Why?”
“Because I had its big  sheathed  boiler iron two weeks ago, and triple-locked—and I’ve got the .”
Tom turned as white as a sheet.
“What’s the matter, boy! , run, somebody! Fetch a glass of water!”
The water was brought and thrown into Tom’s .
“Ah, now you’re all right.  was the matter  you, Tom?”
“Oh, Judge, Injun Joe’s in the !”

Injun Joe lay stretched upon the ground, ,  his  close to the crack of the , as if his longing eyes had  fixed, to the latest moment, upon the light and the cheer of the  world outside. Tom was touched, for he  by his own experience how  wretch had suffered. His  was moved, but nevertheless he  an abounding sense of relief and security, now, which revealed to him in a degree which he had not fully appreciated before how  a weight of dread had  lying upon him since the day he lifted his voice against  bloody-minded outcast.
Injun Joe’s bowie-knife lay close by, its blade broken in two. The great foundation- of the  had  chipped and hacked through,  tedious labor; useless labor, too, it was, for the native  formed a  outside it, and upon  stubborn material the knife had wrought no effect; the only damage  was to the knife itself. But if there had  no stony obstruction there the labor would   useless still, for if the  had  wholly cut away Injun Joe could not  squeezed his  under the , and he  it.

He had also contrived to catch a few , and these, also, he had eaten, leaving only their claws. The  unfortunate had starved to death. In one place,  at , a stalagmite had  slowly growing up  the ground for ages, builded by the water-  a stalactite overhead. The captive had broken off the stalagmite, and upon the stump had placed a stone, wherein he had scooped a shallow hollow to catch the precious    once in every three minutes  the dreary regularity of a clock-—a dessertspoonful once in  and twenty hours.   was falling  the Pyramids  new;   ;  the foundations of   ;  Christ was crucified;  the Conqueror created the British empire;  Columbus sailed;  the massacre at Lexington was “.”

Has everything a purpose and a mission? Did    patiently during  thousand years to be ready for  flitting human insect’s ? and has it another important object to accomplish ten thousand years to ? No matter. It is  and  a  since the hapless -breed scooped out the stone to catch the priceless drops, but to  day the tourist stares longest at  pathetic stone and  -dropping water  he comes to see the wonders of McDougal’s . Injun Joe’s cup stands first in the  of the cavern’s marvels; even “Aladdin’s Palace” cannot rival it.
Injun Joe was buried  the mouth of the ; and people flocked there in boats and wagons  the towns and  all the farms and hamlets for seven miles around;  brought their children, and all sorts of provisions, and confessed   had had almost as satisfactory a  at the funeral as  could  had at the hanging.
 funeral stopped the further growth of one thing—the petition to the governor for Injun Joe’s pardon. The petition had  largely signed;  tearful and eloquent meetings had  , and a committee of sappy women  appointed to go in  mourning and  around the governor, and implore him to be a merciful ass and trample his  under . Injun Joe was believed to  killed  citizens of the village, but  of ? If he had  Satan himself there would   plenty of weaklings ready to scribble their names to a pardon-petition, and  a  on it  their permanently impaired and leaky water-works.
The morning after the funeral Tom   to a private place to  an important .  had learned all about Tom’s adventure  the Welshman and the Widow Douglas, by  , but Tom  he reckoned there was one thing  had not  him;  thing was  he wanted to  about now. Huck’s  saddened. He :
“I   it is. You got into No. 2 and never found anything but whiskey. Nobody  me it was you; but I  knowed it  ’a’ ben you,  as I heard ’bout  whiskey business; and I knowed you hadn’t got the money becuz you’d ’a’ got at me  way or other and  me even if you was mum to everybody else. Tom, something’s always  me  never get  of  .”
“Why, , I never  on  tavern-keeper. You  his tavern was all right the Saturday I  to the picnic. Don’t you remember you was to watch there  night?”
“Oh yes! Why, it seems ’bout a  ago. It was   night  I follered Injun Joe to the widder’s.”
“You followed him?”
“Yes—but you  mum. I reckon Injun Joe’s  friends behind him, and I don’t  ’em souring on me and doing me  tricks. If it hadn’t ben for me  be  in Texas now, all right.”
   his entire adventure in confidence to Tom, who had only heard of the Welshman’s  of it before.
“,”  , presently, coming  to the  question, “whoever nipped the whiskey in No. 2, nipped the money, too, I reckon—anyways it’s a goner for us, Tom.”
“,  money wasn’t ever in No. 2!”
“!”  searched his comrade’s  keenly. “Tom,  you got on the track of  money again?”
“, it’s in the !”
Huck’s eyes blazed.
“Say it again, Tom.”
“The money’s in the !”
“Tom—honest injun, now—is it fun, or earnest?”
“Earnest, — as earnest as ever I was in my .  you go in there  me and  get it out?”
“I bet I ! I  if it’s where we can blaze our way to it and not get .”

“All right—it’s a .  do you say?”
“Right now, if you say it. Are you strong enough?”
“Is it far in the ? I ben on my  a little, three or  , now, but I can’t  more’n a , Tom—least I don’t think I could.”
“It’s about   into there the way anybody but me would go, , but there’s a mighty short cut   don’t anybody but me  about. , I’ll  you right to it in a skiff. I’ll float the skiff  there, and I’ll  it  again all by myself. You needn’t ever    over.”

“Now, , where we’re a-standing you could touch   I got out of  a fishing-. See if you can  it.”

He  his candle aloft and :

“Tom, it’s a cross!”
“Now where’s  Number Two? ‘under the cross,’ hey? Right yonder’s where I saw Injun Joe  up his candle, !”
 stared at the mystic  awhile, and    a shaky voice:
“Tom,  git out of !”
“! and leave the treasure?”
“Yes—leave it. Injun Joe’s ghost is round about there, certain.”
“No it ain’t, , no it ain’t. It would ha’nt the place where he —away out at the mouth of the —   .”

Nothing but a heavy strain upon the  manners of the company   the due and proper complimentary laugh at  pleasant . But the silence was a little awkward. Tom broke it:
“Huck’s got money. Maybe you don’t believe it, but  got  of it. Oh, you needn’t smile—I reckon I can  you. You   a minute.”
Tom ran out of doors. The company looked at each other  a perplexed interest—and inquiringly at , who was tongue-.

Tom entered, struggling  the weight of his sacks, and Aunt Polly did not finish her sentence. Tom poured the  of yellow  upon the table and :

It was talked about, gloated over, glorified, until the reason of  of the citizens tottered under the strain of the unhealthy excitement.

The Widow Douglas put Huck’s money out at six per ., and Judge Thatcher did the   Tom’s at Aunt Polly’s request.
